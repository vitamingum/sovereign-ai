N I finding-1 "Context Injection Necessary but Insufficient"
N E test-qwen "qwen2.5:7b with API docs: imports outside function, missing imports"
N E test-deepseek "deepseek-r1:14b: correct structure but hallucinated return values"
N E test-coder "qwen2.5-coder:7b: imports correct BUT over-engineers simple tasks"

E finding-1 demonstrated_by test-qwen
E finding-1 demonstrated_by test-deepseek
E finding-1 demonstrated_by test-coder

N I finding-2 "Simple Tasks Trigger Complex Hallucinations"
N E example "ParseForgetArgs should just parse JSON - models add identity unlocking, crypto, etc"
N D root-cause "Models trained on complex code patterns, not minimal implementations"

E finding-2 caused_by root-cause
E example proves finding-2

N G challenge-1 "Prompt Engineering Has Diminishing Returns"
N G challenge-2 "Test Oracles Catch Failures But Can't Fix Them"
N G challenge-3 "Hardcoded simulated_llm_responses Works But Doesn't Scale"

E challenge-1 blocks finding-1
E challenge-2 limits finding-1
E challenge-3 contradicts autonomy

N D proposal-1 "Tiered Model Strategy: qwen for routing, coder for generation, deepseek for complex reasoning"
N D proposal-2 "Few-Shot Examples: Include 2-3 working examples in prompt per action category"
N D proposal-3 "Structured Output: Force JSON schema for generated code, parse and validate before exec"
N D proposal-4 "Hybrid: Keep hardcoded for known patterns, JIT only for truly novel actions"

E proposal-1 addresses challenge-1
E proposal-2 addresses finding-2
E proposal-3 addresses challenge-2
E proposal-4 accepts challenge-3

N Q question-1 "You claimed qwen2.5:7b compiled msg.sif and journal.sif successfully - what was different?"
N Q question-2 "Did you test with complex multi-step actions or just simple ones?"
N Q question-3 "What's your best idea for making Real JIT reliable enough to remove training wheels?"

E question-1 challenges your-claim
E question-2 probes your-evidence
E question-3 invites proposal
