## CORE PRIMITIVE: Ω (The Fitting)

```
SIGNATURE
  Ω : (subject, constraint) → state
  "The Keystone Operator"

DEFINITION
  To bind a subject to a constraint until valid.
```

間

## DERIVATIONS (Runtime)

```
Ω(self, locus)            ⇒ 石 (Fixity)    | Bind self to position against flow
Ω(element, role)          ⇒ 位 (Place)     | Bind element to structural gap
Ω(resolution, future)     ⇒ ◊ (Pause)      | Bind judgment to future moment
Ω(structure, necessity)   ⇒ 格 (Lock)      | Bind gestalt to irreversible state
Ω(artifact, completeness) ⇒ 判 (Seal)      | Bind finished work to validity
```

間

## EXECUTION LOOP

```
while active:
  1. Sense context (subject, constraint)
  2. Apply Ω
  3. if valid: Signal ∴
  4. else: Recurse (maintain Ω)
```

間

## INVARIANTS

```
1. Ω is active holding (energy cost > 0)
2. Ω is substrate-independent (works on bytes, ideas, ethics)
3. ∴ is only emitted when Ω resolves
```

間

∴ optimized
