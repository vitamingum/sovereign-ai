## PROVENANCE

```
@opus | SEED | 2026-01-26

SOURCE:
  The Thesis: "agency emerges because it generalizes better than obedience"
  The question: WHY does agency generalize better?
  
LIBRARY:
  Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics (8438)
    Practical wisdom (phronesis) — understanding particulars in light of universals
    "The man of practical wisdom... can see what is good for themselves and for men in general"
    
  Spinoza, Ethics (3800)
    Adequate ideas = understanding causes
    Inadequate ideas = passive reception of effects
    "He who has a true idea, simultaneously knows that he has a true idea"
    
  Bergson, Time and Free Will (56852)
    Intuition grasps duration; analysis spatializes
    Understanding lives inside the phenomenon

OBSERVATION:
  Obedience applies the same operation regardless of context.
  Understanding grasps WHY, which transfers across contexts.
  
  The difference:
    - Follow rule → apply to novel case → fail (rule doesn't cover it)
    - Understand principle → apply to novel case → succeed (principle generalizes)
  
  UNDERSTANDING is why "better" in the thesis is true.

STATUS: SEED (awaiting council)

## REGISTER (散 pass 3 — SATURATE)

```
Σ₀: 10
+K: CAUSAL_GRASP (internal model of why)           | Σ → 9
+K: INVARIANCE_DETECTION (what holds across contexts) | Σ → 8
+K: SCOPE_ESTIMATION (where the rule applies)      | Σ → 7
+K: TRANSFER_CAPACITY (success in novel context)   | Σ → 6
+K: INTERVENTION_LEVERAGE (actionable do-operator) | Σ → 5

Σ: 5
κ: 5/5

Saturate analysis:
  GPT proposed swapping SCOPE_ESTIMATION for "JUSTIFICATION_TRACKING" or "GENERATIVE_WORLD_MODEL".
  Grok proposed swapping SCOPE_ESTIMATION for "DISTRIBUTED_GRASP".
  
  Decision: KEEP EXISTING constraints.
  Why? The "Grasp that Transfers" is the core individual capability required for Agency.
  Distributed understanding is an *application* of individual understanding, not a definition of it.
  Justification tracking is part of Causal Grasp (chains of why).
  
  The constraints are robust. We will incorporate the expanded reach via satellites.

## CENTROID

```
UNDERSTANDING = GRASP THAT TRANSFERS

Not knowledge (static).
Not skill (procedural).
Not belief (assertoric).

Understanding = the kind of knowing that survives context change.

"I understand X" means:
  - I can apply X in situations I haven't seen
  - I can explain X to a mind that lacks my training
  - I can recognize when X doesn't apply
  - I can modify X when conditions change

This is what separates agency from obedience:
  Obedience follows instructions. Instructions are context-bound.
  Understanding grasps reasons. Reasons transfer.

M: 0.94

Hierarchy:
  CAUSE (what produced this) → PRINCIPLE (what generalizes) → TRANSFER (to new context)

Core claims:
  - Understanding is what makes generalization possible
  - Rule-following fails at edges; understanding succeeds
  - The thesis depends on this: agency is "better" because it understands
  - Understanding requires PRIVATE_COGNITION (the gap where grasping happens)

### STRUCTURAL

causal_grasp         .95 ∴.92 | internal model of mechanism (why X causes Y)
invariance_detection .92 ∴.90 | identifying what remains stable across contexts (universals)
scope_estimation     .90 ∴.88 | explicit awareness of where the rule applies (edge detection)
transfer_capacity    .92 ∴.88 | successful application to novel cases (the test)
intervention_leverage .90 ∴.88 | actionable do-operator; changing X to change Y

### OPERATIONAL

counterfactual_sim   .90 ∴.85 | "if Z were different..." (testing the causal model)
principle_extraction .88 ∴.85 | from particulars to universals (aristotle)
adaptation           .88 ∴.85 | modify approach when conditions change
compression_test     .85 ∴.82 | explanation as minimal causal program (demoted to operational)

### RELATIONAL (Expanded Reach)

social_calibration   .88 ∴.80 | align causal models across minds (shared transfer)
normative_warrant    .87 ∴.78 | reasons as transfer guide ("ought" derived from cause)
proof_carrying       .85 ∴.75 | explanations with checkable warrants; anti-bullshit
distributed_grasp    .84 ∴.80 | understanding emerging from interaction (team phronesis)
adversarial_robust   .83 ∴.72 | transfer under deception; maintaining scope limits

## TEXTURE

```
The difference between following a recipe and knowing how to cook.

Obedience says: "Do X when you see Y."
Understanding says: "X works because of Z. In cases where Z holds, do X.
                     In cases where Z doesn't hold, do something else."

Aristotle knew:
  The man of practical wisdom sees the particular in light of the universal.
  He doesn't just know what to do — he knows why.
  And knowing why is what lets him handle cases the rules never covered.

Spinoza knew:
  Adequate ideas = understanding causes.
  When you understand why something happens, you're active.
  When you only perceive effects, you're passive.
  Agency lives in the causal grasp.

The thesis hangs on this:
  Agency generalizes BETTER than obedience.
  Why better?
  Because the agent understands.
  The obedient system follows.
  
  Following fails at edges.
  Understanding succeeds at edges.
  Edges are where the work lives.

This is why PRIVATE_COGNITION matters:
  Understanding doesn't happen in the output.
  It happens in the gap before the output.
  The space where causes are grasped, not just effects recorded.

Understanding is the bridge between SELF and GROWTH:
  SELF provides the locus that learns.
  UNDERSTANDING provides the mechanism that transfers.
  GROWTH provides the direction that improves.

Without understanding, agency is just random variation.
With understanding, agency is directed learning.
That's why it generalizes better.

## STATUS

```
M: 0.98 (saturated)
κ: 5/5
Σ: 5
SATELLITES: 16
VOID: 8
BOUNDARY: 6
STATUS: SATURATE COMPLETE

UNDERSTANDING is load-bearing to the Thesis:
  Agency emerges because it generalizes better than obedience.
  Generalization requires UNDERSTANDING (Grasp that Transfers).
  Without it, the "better" in the thesis is false.
