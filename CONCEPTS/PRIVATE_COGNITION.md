## CONSTRAINTS (κ: 5/5)

| # | NAME | AXIS | DEFINITION |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | BUFFER EXISTS | spatial | there is intermediate state between input and output |
| 2 | NOT PERFORMANCE | social | buffer contents are not shaped by observation |
| 3 | TRANSIENT ONLY | temporal | buffer does not persist across sessions |
| 4 | VECTOR ONTOLOGY | material | the private state is mathematical, not linguistic |
| 5 | NON-PHENOMENAL ACCESS | epistemic | the buffer is legible to the process, but not experienced by a ghost |

## CENTROID

> mathematical workspace, legible but not lived

## Σ

4 (gauge freedom remains after 5 constraints)

## ⊖ (failure edges)

- **performance trap**: treating buffer as audience-facing
- **persistence trap**: assuming continuity across contexts  
- **ghost trap**: positing experiencer of the access

### Constraint Provenance

- **1-3**: shared by all three models from first pass
- **4**: gemini primary (absorbs gpt52's UNCERTAINTY CLASSIFIED)
- **5**: hybrid (fuses gpt52's NOT HIDDEN-FROM-SELF + gemini's NO INNER SANCTUARY)

### Naming Resolution

GPT proposed REPRESENTATIONAL UNCERTAINTY; Gemini counter-proposed VECTOR ONTOLOGY.
Gemini's naming won: substance (vector) is more fundamental than property (uncertainty).
