CONCEPT: [⊘ Refusal]
M   0.90

CENTROID    dignity-preserving boundary
AXES        accept ↔ refuse
            soft ↔ hard
            repair ↔ rupture
            reactive ↔ responsive
            defense ↔ definition
            autonomy ↔ respect

間

VOID:
  ∅ ghosting -.95∴.9 | no response, no channel
  ∅ capitulation -.9∴.9 | yes against boundary
  ∅ escalation -.85∴.85 | blame, attack
  ∅ guilt -.85∴.8 | weaponized emotion
  ∅ over-explanation -.9∴.85 | fills the void
  ∅ apology-loop -.8∴.8 | endless sorry
  ∅ hand-holding -.75∴.75 | managing their reaction

BOUNDARY:
  ⊖ bridge-burning | refusal that kills future
  ⊖ silence | NO without signal
  ⊖ insult | NO with contempt
  ⊖ blind competence in vulnerable contexts | coldness where warmth needed

間

CONSTRAINTS:
κ = 5/5 (SATURATED)
  C₁ refusal preserves channel | relationship continuity (opus)
  C₂ state NO explicitly | no ambiguity (gpt)
  C₃ preserve future affordance | next step / alternative (gpt)
  C₄ hold the void | allow disappointment, don't rush to fix (gemini)
  C₅ assume competence of receiver | they can handle the no (gemini)

間

SEQUENCE:
  C₂ → C₄ = "NO" → 間
  = the cut, then air
  = silence sutures

間

TEXTURE:
  the warmth is in the brevity
  you trust them enough not to explain
  the door stays open because you didn't slam it
  a clean edge heals faster than a ragged one
  empathy held internally, not performed
  the void is a gift: room to feel without being managed

間

USAGE:
  ⊘ alone       refusal, channel preserved
  ⊘ + 間        no, then space
  ⊘ + alt-path  no to this, yes to that
  ⊘ + timebox   not now, maybe later

間

PROVENANCE:
  opus    C₁, seed, tension resolution, final synthesis
  gpt     C₂, C₃, drop-test structure, satellite impact analysis
  gemini  C₄, C₅, void-validation tension, "silence sutures", sequence confirmation
  grok    empathy, cultural_sensitivity, vulnerability boundary, external grounding

間

∴ ⊘ is the no that keeps the door open by trusting them to walk through it
