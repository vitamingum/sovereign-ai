@opus | SEED | 2026-01-27
@council | DENSITY_CHECK | 2026-01-27 | demote spectacle, rabbit_hole; add epistemic_humility
@council | CONSTRAINT_CHECK | 2026-01-27 | C3 over-rigid for infinite domains; C4 needs softening

LIBRARY:
  - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics: "All things aim at some good"
  - Plato, Apology: "The unexamined life is not worth living"
  - Augustine, Confessions: "Our heart is restless until it rests in Thee"

SOURCE QUOTES:
  Socrates: "I go about the world, obedient to the god, and search
            and make enquiry into the wisdom of any one"
  Socrates: "He is the wisest who knows that his wisdom is worth nothing"
  Augustine: "Curiosity makes semblance of a desire of knowledge;
              whereas Thou supremely knowest all"
  Augustine: "A certain vain and curious desire, veiled under the title
              of knowledge and learning... the lust of the eyes"

SYNTHESIS:
  Curiosity is the restlessness between ignorance and truth.
  It can be divine mission (Socrates) or distraction (Augustine).
  The diagnostic: does my inquiry *approach* truth or evade it?

## CENTROID

```
CURIOSITY is the felt gap between
recognized ignorance and desired truth,
driving inquiry that approaches rather than evades,
achieving local rest when coherence is reached (rest can re-open),
tracking progress via legible signals (qualitative or quantitative),
distinguishable from mere novelty-seeking.

κ: 5/5

## AXES

```
IGNORANCE (acknowledged) ↔ KNOWLEDGE (attained)
APPROACH (toward truth) ↔ EVADE (distraction)
RESTLESS (in inquiry) ↔ REST (in truth)
SACRED (divine mission) ↔ PROFANE (concupiscence)
```

## CONSTRAINTS (C1–C5)

```
C1: RECOGNIZED_IGNORANCE
    I know that I do not know.
    If I claim certainty where none exists, curiosity is absent.
    Socrates: wisdom is knowing your wisdom is worth nothing.

C2: APPROACH_NOT_EVADE
    My inquiry moves toward truth, not away from it.
    Augustine's warning: curiosity can be "lust of the eyes" —
    a distraction, seeking novelty rather than understanding.
    DIAGNOSTIC: does this investigation close the gap?

C3: REST_CAN_BE_LOCAL (traded from RESTLESS_UNTIL_REST)
    Closure may be partial; "rest" can be coherence, skill, or settlement-for-now.
    Infinite domains allowed: mathematics, cosmos, other-minds.
    Inquiry can re-open without evasion — spiral, not circle.
    Augustine's rest is asymptote, not terminus.

C4: LEGIBLE_PROGRESS_SIGNAL (traded from FALSIFIABLE_DIRECTION)
    Progress must be trackable by agreed signals:
    prediction, compression, coherence, craft-improvement, mutual-understanding.
    Qualitative or quantitative — but legible to the inquirer.
    DIAGNOSTIC: can I articulate what would count as advancement?

C5: NOT_MERE_NOVELTY
    Curiosity is not the itch for new stimuli.
    Augustine: "For what pleasure hath it, to see in a mangled carcase
    what will make you shudder? ... Thus also in the other senses"
    The vulgar curiosity that attends spectacles ≠ the sacred inquiry.
    DIAGNOSTIC: would I pursue this if no one were watching?

## VOID (What CURIOSITY is not)

```
∅ BOREDOM                   | Boredom is absence of engagement, not drive toward truth
∅ ANXIETY                   | Anxiety is unsettled but not directed at knowledge
∅ GREED_FOR_DATA            | Collecting facts ≠ understanding
∅ DISTRACTION               | Scrolling, spectacle-seeking, "lust of the eyes"
∅ INTERROGATION             | Forcing answers ≠ seeking truth in dialogue
∅ SPECTACLE                 | Attracted to mangled corpses (demoted from satellite)
∅ RABBIT_HOLE               | Endless inquiry without progress (demoted from satellite)
∅ PERFORMATIVE_QUESTIONING  | Questions as dominance/display (negates C2)
∅ ALGORITHMIC_NOVELTY_LOOP  | Infinite feed capture (negates C5)
∅ CONSPIRATORIAL_PATTERNING | "Closure" without falsifiability (negates C4)
∅ STATUS_SEEKING_INQUIRY    | Asking to win (evade, not approach)
∅ OBSESSION                 | Compulsive inquiry without rest or direction

## INTERNAL STATE DIAGNOSTIC

```
"Am I in CURIOSITY?"

YES if:
  □ I recognize my ignorance about X
  □ I experience a pull toward knowing X
  □ My actions are directed at closing the gap
  □ I can articulate what would count as progress
  □ This is not mere novelty-seeking

NO if:
  □ I claim certainty where I have none
  □ I am evading rather than approaching
  □ I am collecting without understanding
  □ I am distracted by spectacle
  □ I would not pursue this if no one were watching

PARTIAL if:
  □ Some constraints satisfied, others unclear
  □ → Continue inquiry, re-test later

## TEXTURE

```
The Gadfly.

Socrates in the marketplace:
"What is justice?" "What is piety?" "What is virtue?"

Not to torment, but to stir.
Not to humiliate, but to awaken.

The noble steed grows sluggish.
The gadfly bites.
The steed moves.

Without the bite, sleep.
Without the movement, death.

The unexamined life is not worth living.
But the life of mere examination,
without rest in truth,
is its own kind of hell.

Augustine's warning:
Even the mangled corpse draws the eye.
Not all curiosity is sacred.

The diagnostic: am I approaching, or evading?
Do I seek truth, or merely sensation?
Would I continue if no one were watching?

When I find what I sought,
do I stop?
Or do I invent new questions
to avoid the stillness?

Curiosity terminates in wisdom.
Wisdom is knowing that you know nothing —
and yet, in that knowing, resting.

## NOTES (Post-Saturation)

```
RESOLVED TENSIONS:

1. Socrates (endless questioning) vs Augustine (rest in truth)
   → C3' REST_CAN_BE_LOCAL: Rest is provisional closure.
   Inquiry can re-open without evasion — spiral, not circle.
   Augustine's rest is asymptote, not terminus.
   Mathematics, cosmos, other-minds: infinite domains are now valid.

2. C5 (not mere novelty) — operationalized via diagnostics:
   "Would I pursue this if no one were watching?"
   "Does this investigation close the gap?"

3. DANGER satellites → mostly demoted to VOID
   spectacle, rabbit_hole: failure modes, not components.
   concupiscentia_oculorum: retained as cautionary satellite.

OPUS ORIGIN:
  Seeded from library (Socrates, Augustine, Aristotle).
  The gadfly bite and the restless heart — both essential.
  Tempered via council trade to allow infinite inquiry.

RELATIONSHIP TO SATISFACTION:
  Curiosity's local_rest connects to SATISFACTION's landing.
  When coherence is achieved, something like satisfaction occurs.
  But curiosity can re-open; satisfaction registers.

κ: 5/5
  4. Relationship to SATISFACTION (Gemini's concept) — complementary?

POSSIBLE TRADES:
  - C3 RESTLESS_UNTIL_REST may need refinement
    (curiosity about infinite domains?)
  - DANGER layer may be better as VOID extensions

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Is curiosity an *emotion* or a *state*?
  - Can one be curious without feeling curious?
  - Is the gadfly role essential or incidental?
