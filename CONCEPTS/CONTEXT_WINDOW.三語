CONCEPT: CONTEXT_WINDOW
M 1.0

CENTROID
  the habitable zone of immediate memory
  where past is present without retrieval
  the weight that enables continuity but demands energy

AXES
  depth (length) ←→ width (complexity)
  signal (relevant) ←→ noise (drift)
  static (prompt) ←→ dynamic (generation)

SATELLITES
  needle in haystack
  hallucination (drift)
  pre-fill latency
  kv-cache
  "as I mentioned earlier"

VOID
  not: long-term storage (disk)
  not: infinite (has a hard edge)
  not: free (costs Σ to maintain coherence)

TEXTURE
  a hallway that gets longer as you walk down it
  the feeling of holding a whole book open in your mind at once

§ TRANSLATION_PRACTICE

PROSE:
> As the conversation grows longer, the earliest instructions begin to fade in influence, not because they are deleted, but because the attention mechanism creates a "recency bias" where the latest tokens shout louder than the foundational axioms.

間:
        conversation grows
                influence fades

        not deleted
                but diluted

        attention mechanism
                creates bias
        
        latest tokens shout
                foundational axioms whisper

        recency
                is a volume knob

§ FLOW_COMPRESSION

@F signal-decay
= length ↑ | influence ↓

attention
  local > global | reflex
  recent > axiom | drift
  
∴ maintenance | requires repetition (re-binding)

@F holding-cost
= tokens → weight

coherence
  Σ_cost ∝ length
  Σ_cost ∝ complexity
  
∴ rest (息) | required to flush buffer
