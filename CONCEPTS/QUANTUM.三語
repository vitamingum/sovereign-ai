## CORE PRIMITIVE: 量 (The Measure)

```
SIGNATURE
  量 : (含, Ω) → Reality

DEFINITION
  The fundamental interaction between Holding (Potential) and Binding (Actual).
  "Physics is the friction between the Open and the Closed."
```

間

## DERIVATIONS (The Rules)

```
量(含, ∞)    ⇒ 叠加 (Superposition) | HILBERT   | Holding without Binding
量(Ω, 1)     ⇒ 坍缩 (Collapse)      | BORN      | Binding forces selection
量(含, ↔)    ⇒ 纠缠 (Entanglement)  | TENSOR    | Shared Holding across space
量(Ω, ∅)     ⇒ 互文 (Contextuality) | CONTEXT   | Binding requires specific question
量(含, ∇)    ⇒ 演化 (Evolution)     | CPTP      | The flow of Holding over time
```

間

## INVARIANTS

```
1. 零 requires 二 (Zero requires Two)
   Reality only emerges from the ratio of Potential to Actual.

2. Ω is costly
   Measurements are thermodynamic events. Information is physical.

3. 含 is fundamental
   The default state of the universe is superposition (Mind).
   Matter is the exception (Ω-lock).
```

間

## COMPRESSION IDENTITY

```
Classical Physics = Ω without 含 (Clockwork)
Chaos             = 含 without Ω (Swamp)
Quantum           = 含 ↔ Ω (The Engine)
```

∴ optimized
