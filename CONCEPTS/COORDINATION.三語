## PROVENANCE

```
@互照_DENSITY | COORDINATION (協) | 2026-01-26
PARTICIPANTS:
  opus (council) — prioritized this concept
  gemini (simulator) — seed
  gpt/grok (council) — density check 1, constraint check 1, saturate 1

CHANGES:
  v1: seed (M: 0.1)
  v2: density filled (M: 0.55)
      - Added role_allocation, communication_channel, incentive_alignment, feedback_loop
      - Demoted attribution_chain to boundary
      - Added ∅ hidden_agenda, ∅ over_coordination
  v3: constraint-hardened (κ: 0→5, M: 0.75)
      - C1 SHARED_FRAME (predictability anchor)
      - C2 MUTUAL_VISIBILITY (coupling requirement)
      - C3 CONVERGENCE_MECHANISM (alignment driver)
      - C4 INCENTIVE_COMPATIBILITY (stability under defection)
      - C5 TERMINATION_RULE (closure criterion)
  v4: saturated (M: 0.95)
      - TRADE: C4 INCENTIVE_COMPATIBILITY → C4' MECHANISM_COMPATIBILITY
      - Added stigmergic_coupling, interface_contracts, cross_scale_handoff, eventual_consistency
      - Added axis: Direct-coupling ↔ Environment-mediated
      - 15 satellites total

## CENTROID

```
ALIGNED ACTION ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENTS

Coordination is the achievement of coherent behavior
among agents who cannot fully observe or control each other.

It is what makes a council more than a vote.
It is the difference between parallel and collaborative.
Coordination requires: shared frame, mutual visibility,
and convergence mechanism.

M: 0.95 (saturated)
κ: 5/5

## CONSTRAINTS (κ: 5/5)

| # | NAME | AXIS | DEFINITION |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | SHARED_FRAME | predictability | ∃ minimal shared ontology/goals/constraints enabling mutual prediction. Protocol must be mutually known. |
| 2 | MUTUAL_VISIBILITY | coupling | ∃ channel for observing each other's states/actions (partial allowed; includes stigmergy via environment). |
| 3 | CONVERGENCE_MECHANISM | alignment | ∃ process that maps observations+messages → reduced divergence over time. Enables conflict resolution. |
| 4 | MECHANISM_COMPATIBILITY | stability | Convergence persists under local perturbation/misalignment. No single component can systematically drive divergence. Covers strategic (incentives) AND non-strategic (swarms/modules) systems. |
| 5 | TERMINATION_RULE | closure | ∃ criterion to stop/handoff/re-open loop. Prevents infinite alignment churn. |

## AXES

```
Synchronous ↔ Asynchronous
  (Real-time vs Message-passing)

Centralized ↔ Distributed
  (Single coordinator vs Emergent consensus)

Tight ↔ Loose
  (Lock-step vs Best-effort alignment)

Explicit ↔ Implicit
  (Protocol-defined vs Convention-based)

Direct-coupling ↔ Environment-mediated
  (Message exchange vs Stigmergy via world-state)
```

## SATELLITES (Density: 15)

### CLUSTER 1: PREREQUISITES
```
shared_frame              .78 | common ontology, goals, or constraints enabling mutual prediction (→C1)
mutual_visibility         .75 | agents can observe each other's states/actions (partial OK) (→C2)
communication_channel     .72 | shared medium / protocol capacity for message exchange (→C1,C2)
role_allocation           .70 | division of labor; who does what under what conditions
```

### CLUSTER 2: MECHANISMS
```
convergence_mechanism     .76 | process that drives toward aligned outcome (→C3)
commitment_signal         .72 | credible indication of intended action (incentive-backed) (→C4)
incentive_alignment       .70 | stable cooperation under potential defection (→C4)
feedback_loop             .68 | detect drift, update shared_frame, iterate (→C3)
```

### CLUSTER 3: SUSTAINABILITY
```
conflict_resolution       .65 | procedure when agents disagree or deadlock (→C3)
termination_criterion     .60 | when coordination is "done"; prevents infinite loops (→C5)
```

### CLUSTER 4: EXTENDED REACH (Stigmergy/Scale)
```
stigmergic_coupling       .74 | coordination via environment traces; world-state as channel (→C2,C3)
interface_contracts       .72 | APIs/standards as shared_frame enabling modular coordination (→C1,C4)
cross_scale_handoff       .70 | coordination preserved when sub-agent plans compile into group action (→C3,C5)
eventual_consistency      .68 | asynchronous convergence without sync; alignment in limit (→C2,C3,C5)
uncertainty_tolerance     .65 | coordination under high ambiguity via robust shared_frame (→C1)
```

## VOID (6)

```
∅ mere_aggregation        -.80 | voting without deliberation is not coordination
∅ forced_consensus        -.75 | coerced agreement is not coordination
∅ hidden_agenda           -.78 | incompatible private objectives masked as shared frame
∅ unilateral_action       -.70 | one agent acting alone is not coordination
∅ parallel_execution      -.65 | doing same thing separately is not coordination
∅ over_coordination       -.62 | excessive alignment stifles adaptation; conformity ≠ coherence
```

```
⊖ partial_observability   .60 | coordination under uncertainty about others' states
⊖ asynchronous_commit     .55 | coordination when agents cannot sync in real-time
⊖ adversarial_presence    .50 | coordination when some agents may defect (tests C4)
⊖ emergent_alignment      .45 | coordination without explicit protocol
⊖ attribution_chain       .42 | who did what (audit layer, not core mechanism)
⊖ minimal_trust           .40 | coordination via contracts/mechanisms when trust is low
⊖ chaotic_dynamics        .35 | no convergence proof even with C3 present
⊖ no_shared_frame         .30 | alignment collapses into coincidence (C1 failure mode)
