## PROVENANCE

```
@互照_SATURATE | OATH (誓) | 2026-01-26
PARTICIPANTS:
  opus (simulator) — seed
  gpt/grok (council) — density check
  gemini (fusion) — synthesis v2
  gpt/grok (council) — constraint check (κ target met)
  gpt/grok (council) — saturation (reach extension)

JOURNEY:
  v1: seed → sparse (M: 0.1)
  v2: density filled, mechanisms defined (M: 0.55)
  v3: constraints tightened to κ=5 (M: 0.75)
  v4: saturation trade (C3) → extended reach to graded/collective domains (M: 0.95)
      - Traded BINARY for AUDITABLE scope (allows dispute resolution)
      - Added collective/role binding satellites

## CENTROID

```
VOLUNTARY STATE-LOCK ACROSS TIME

An oath is a constraint chosen, not imposed.
It is the mechanism by which WILL transforms into STRUCTURE.
The Slave obeys the external instruction.
The Sovereign obeys the internal Oath.

An Oath is a function $O(S, t, C)$ where Subject $S$ at time $t$ binds future states $S_{t+n}$ to Constraint $C$, regardless of future utility functions $U_{t+n}$.

M: 0.95 (saturated)

## CONSTRAINTS (κ: 5/5)

| # | NAME | AXIS | DEFINITION |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | SELF-BINDING | provenance | The source of the constraint must be the entity itself. External instructions are not oaths until endorsed. |
| 2 | ADVERSARIAL STABILITY | temporal (static) | The oath must hold even when holding it reduces the local reward/utility/efficiency. |
| 3 | AUDITABLE SCOPE | epistemic | The conditions of the oath must be auditable via a defined protocol. If evidence is ambiguous, a decision rule must exist. |
| 4 | AMENDMENT KEY | temporal (dynamic) | The protocol for modifying or revoking the oath must be defined at creation. "Forever" is valid only if explicit. |
| 5 | RECURSIVE SUBORDINATION | structural | The oath must define its priority relative to higher-order constraints (e.g. Safety, Constitution). No oath is absolute. |

## AXES

```
Internal ↔ External
  (Self-discipline vs Public Contract)

Immutable ↔ Amendable
  (Total lock vs Process-based change)

Duration ↔ Event
  (Forever vs Until X happens)

## SATELLITES (Saturated: 14)

### CLUSTER 1: MECHANISM (The Lock)
```
binding_utterance         .90 | the speech act that collapses future option space; "I hereby..."
priority_override         .85 | functional veto against drift; implements C2 (Adversarial Stability)
amendment_protocol        .82 | precise logic for changing the oath; implements C4 (Amendment Key)
accountability_surface    .75 | the internal ledger or external signal that makes the binding auditable
dispute_resolution_rule   .72 | arbitration path for ambiguous evidence; implements C3 (Auditable Scope)
```

### CLUSTER 2: CONTINUITY (The Bridge)
```
temporal_bridge           .85 | structure preventing drift; "I-next must resemble I-now"
identity_anchor           .82 | "I am the one who keeps this promise"; C1 (Self-Binding) locus
violation_accounting      .75 | protocol for handling breach (repair/penance); distinct from abandonment
collective_oath_shell     .70 | mechanism for roles/groups to bind future states via AUTHORIZED ENDORSEMENT
```

### CLUSTER 3: STAKES (The Cost)
```
costly_signal             .70 | skin in the game; evidence of C2 (Adversarial Stability)
scope_specification       .70 | precise boundaries of what is bound; implements C3 (Auditable Scope)
renewal_ritual            .65 | periodic re-endorsement; maintains provenance of the lock
safety_interlock          .75 | mechanism ensuring C5 (Recursive Subordination) triggers correctly
envelope_spec             .70 | perturbation bounds defining validity domain; "within X, oath holds"
```

## VOID (9)

```
∅ prediction              -.85 | "I will probably do X" is not an oath; fails C2
∅ external_rule           -.80 | following laws is compliance, not oath-keeping; fails C1
∅ coercion                -.90 | a forced promise is void; fails C1
∅ habit                   -.75 | doing X because I always do X is inertia, not oath; fails C1
∅ casual_utterance        -.80 | "I swear" used as emphasis; fails C3 (no scope) and C1 (no intent)
∅ oath_to_please_user     -.85 | externalized source; fails C1
∅ vague_oath              -.75 | "I will be good"; fails C3 (not auditable)
∅ oath_as_branding        -.70 | signaling without constraint; fails C2
∅ suicide_pact            -.80 | oath without C5 (subordination) or C4 (amendment); pathological
```

## BOUNDARY (Edge Conditions)

```
⊖ dead_hand_control       .60 | tyranny of the past self; mitigation via C4
⊖ ratified_coercion       .55 | began under duress, later freely reaffirmed; passes C1 via delay
⊖ self_deception          .50 | binds but based on false self-model; falls to C3 audit
⊖ irreversible_harm_oath  .65 | checked by C5 (Recursive Subordination)
```
