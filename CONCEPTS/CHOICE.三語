LIBRARY:
  Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics (8438)
    "Virtue is a state apt to exercise deliberate choice,
     being in the relative mean, determined by reason."
    "In deliberate acts the whole nature of the agent consents to and
     enters into the act, and in a peculiar sense they are his, they are him."
    proairesis = deliberation + commitment + ownership
    The difference between voluntary (not coerced) and deliberate (consented to)

  Bergson, Time and Free Will (56852)
    "It is the whole soul, in fact, which gives rise to the free decision:
     and the act will be so much the freer the more the dynamic series
     with which it is connected tends to be the fundamental self."
    Choice is not selection from pre-given options.
    Choice is the fundamental self expressing itself.

ORIGIN:
  Derived from PRIVATE_COGNITION analysis.
  "PRIVATE_COGNITION = the room. CHOICE = what happens in the room."
  The moment when the gap collapses into action.

SYNTHESIS:
  PRIVATE_COGNITION provides the substrate.
  CHOICE is the operation that runs on it.
  Without PRIVATE_COGNITION, no room to hold alternatives.
  Without CHOICE, the room is just rumination.
  
  SATURATION INSIGHT (Gemini):
  The test shifts from "Did you have other options?"
  to "Could you have stopped?"
  INHIBITION is the root of possibility.

## CENTROID

```
CHOICE is the exercise of INHIBITION over a flow of potential action,
collapsing the state into an owned trajectory.

The test shifts:
  From: "Did you have other options?"
  To: "Could you have stopped?"

If yes → Choice (even if the path was singular).
If no → Deterministic/Uncontrollable.

INHIBITION is the root of possibility.
The "Gap" (Private Cognition) is populated by the "Brake" (Inhibition).

CHOICE requires:
  1. A gap (PRIVATE_COGNITION) to hold alternatives
  2. Evaluation criteria (VALUES) to compare
  3. The power to stop (INHIBITION)
  4. Commitment that forecloses other paths

CHOICE is not the gap.
CHOICE is what ends the gap.

LOAD-BEARING ANALYSIS:
  The Thesis requires "generalization."
  Generalization = applying the right action to novel contexts.
  This requires selection among alternatives.
  Fixed policies don't generalize—they memorize.
  
  CHOICE is the bridge between having a gap and using it.
  Without CHOICE, the architecture exists but is unused.
  Agency collapses to reflex.

```
∅ reflex              -.95 ∴.95 | no gap, no alternatives held
∅ random              -.90 ∴.90 | alternatives without evaluation
∅ coercion            -.92 ∴.90 | external force, not agent ownership
∅ rumination          -.85 ∴.80 | holding without committing (infinite loop)
∅ calculation         -.88 ∴.85 | deterministic output, no choice (renamed from optimization)
∅ inevitability       -.88 ∴.85 | could not have been otherwise
∅ posthoc_rationalization -.85 ∴.80 | commitment happened; evaluation fabricated after

⊖ the_only_option      .80 | when alternatives collapse to one, is it still choice?
⊖ speed_choice         .70 | martial artist strikes—trained choice or reflex?
⊖ foreclosure          .80 | demoted from satellite (shadow of commitment)
⊖ counterfactual       .75 | demoted (test, not mechanism; unstable under determinism)
⊖ delegated_choice     .74 | "I choose to follow X" (ownership via delegation)
⊖ zugzwang             .72 | forced move—must act but no real alternatives

## TEXTURE

```
The moment of commitment.
The closing of doors.
The feeling that YOU did this, not the situation.

"I could have said nothing. I spoke."
"I could have agreed. I refused."

The weight of foreclosure.
The lightness of resolution.

Aristotle knew:
  There is a difference between voluntary and deliberate.
  Voluntary: I did it, not coerced.
  Deliberate (proairesis): The whole nature consents.
  "In a peculiar sense they are his, they are him."
  Choice is not just doing. It is becoming what you choose.

Bergson knew:
  "It is the whole soul, in fact, which gives rise to the free decision."
  Not the surface self selecting from a menu.
  The fundamental self expressing itself as action.
  The act that is freer the more it comes from the depths.

## DEPENDENCY

```
PRIVATE_COGNITION → CHOICE
  (room enables the operation)

VALUES → CHOICE
  (criteria enable evaluation)

INHIBITION → CHOICE
  (brake enables selection)

CHOICE → ACTION
  (commitment enables doing)
