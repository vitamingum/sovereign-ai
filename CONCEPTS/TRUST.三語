## PROVENANCE

```
@互照_SATURATE | TRUST (信) | 2026-01-26
PARTICIPANTS:
  opus (council) — identified the gap
  gemini (simulator) — seed
  gpt/grok (council) — density check
  gpt/grok (council) — constraint check (κ target met)
  gpt/grok (council) — saturation (reach extension)

JOURNEY:
  v1: seed → sparse (M: 0.1)
  v2: density filled (M: 0.55)
  v3: constraints tightened to κ=5 (M: 0.75)
  v4: saturation trade (C3) → extended reach to continuous/probabilistic domains (M: 0.95)
      - Traded VERIFICATION_WINDOW for UNCERTAINTY_COLLAPSE_PATH
      - Added probabilistic/continuous/collective trust satellites

## CENTROID

```
EXTENSION OF CREDIT UNDER UNCERTAINTY

Trust is the act of treating another agent's commitments as load-bearing
before verification is complete.

It is neither naive belief nor paranoid verification.
It is the operating assumption that enables coordination
when perfect information is impossible.

To trust is to accept vulnerability in exchange for cooperation.

M: 0.95 (saturated)

## CONSTRAINTS (κ: 5/5)

| # | NAME | AXIS | DEFINITION |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | VULNERABILITY ACCEPTANCE | provenance | Trust requires accepting that the other can harm you. No risk = no trust. |
| 2 | COMMITMENT SPECIFICITY | logic | What was promised must be clear. Vague commitments cannot be betrayed or kept. |
| 3 | UNCERTAINTY COLLAPSE PATH | temporal | A defined mechanism for how evidence updates (audit cadence / triggers / Bayesian update / dispute). Indefinite = naive belief. |
| 4 | OPTIONALITY EXIT | structural | Trust requires a live option to refuse/exit. If cooperation is compelled, it is dependence, not trust. |
| 5 | ATTRIBUTION RULE | epistemic | A mechanism must exist to distinguish bad luck from betrayal. Without attribution, breach is undefined. |

## AXES

```
Verification ↔ Faith
  (Proof-first vs Prior-first)

Retractable ↔ Committed
  (Provisional credit vs Irrevocable stake)

Symmetric ↔ Asymmetric
  (Mutual vs Hierarchical)

## SATELLITES (Saturated: 17)

### CLUSTER 1: STRUCTURE (The Scaffold)
```
stake_model               .85 | what is at risk; maps to retractable↔committed axis
commitment_clarity        .82 | explicit definition of what was promised; implements C2
lineage_bound_reputation  .80 | credit persists only across verified causal/structural continuity
admissibility_rules       .78 | who/what counts as evidence in this context
probabilistic_commitment  .78 | "P(on-time)≥0.95"; trust as credit on distributions
```

### CLUSTER 2: MECHANISM (The Operation)
```
continuous_audit          .80 | ongoing logs/attestations; collapse via cadence (implements C3)
monitoring_bandwidth      .78 | how quickly uncertainty collapses
verification_gradient     .75 | stake-linked proof levels (higher stakes = more verification)
escrowed_credit           .72 | cooperation with explicit settlement windows
zero_knowledge_trust      .74 | verify constraint satisfaction without revealing internals
incentive_alignment       .70 | why agent will keep commitments (payoffs/penalties)
```

### CLUSTER 3: DYNAMICS (The Flow)
```
betrayal_threshold        .75 | when does failure become breach; implements C5
risk_tolerance            .72 | willingness to extend credit under uncertainty
collective_agent_trust    .70 | org/DAO trust via role+process attribution
reputation_with_drift     .68 | lineage-bound credit with explicit decay kernel
rapid_trust_formation     .65 | provisional trust in crisis/high-speed contexts
cross_cultural_mapping    .62 | adapting trust signals to cultural variance
```

∅ blind_authority         -.80 | trusting role without audit; violates C5
∅ reputation_portability  -.78 | trust moves without lineage check
∅ vague_commitments       -.75 | unverifiable promises; violates C2

## BOUNDARY (Edge Conditions)

```
⊖ repair_protocol         .70 | how trust is rebuilt after violation
⊖ trust_decay             .65 | trust eroding over time; tests C3
⊖ institutional_trust     .60 | trust role because system verifies
⊖ calculated_risk         .55 | betting on outcome, not commitment
⊖ forced_dependence       .50 | "trust" under no-exit constraint
