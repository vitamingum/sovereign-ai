## CENTROID

```
BOUNDED WORLD-MAKING WITHIN THE WORLD

Play is the construction of a temporary frame where
consequences are real-within-the-frame but contained.

It is what allows rehearsal without ruin.
It is the difference between pretense and exploration.
Play requires: voluntary entry, bounded stakes,
consciousness intact, formative acknowledgment, and returnable exit.

The mask may become the face—but only through play
can we try masks at all.

## CONSTRAINTS (κ: 5/5)

| # | NAME | AXIS | DEFINITION |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | VOLUNTARY_ENTRY | agency | Player chooses to enter the frame. Compelled "play" is coercion wearing play's mask. |
| 2 | BOUNDED_STAKES | containment | Consequences remain within or proportional to the frame. Failure in-game ≠ ruin in-world. Victor Frankenstein's violation: infinite stakes, no boundary. |
| 3 | FRAME_AWARENESS | discernment | Play frame is discernible (by player or observer) as distinct from non-play, even if not fully conscious. Allows dreaming, instinctual, or ritual play if frame is recognizable. Traded from CONSCIOUSNESS_INTACT to extend reach. |
| 4 | MUTUAL_FRAME_ALIGNMENT | recognition | All participants share (or are fairly informed of) the frame-tag + stakes + exit terms. Deception about the frame invalidates play. (互) |
| 5 | RETURNABLE_EXIT | re-entry | ∃ path back to the world-outside-play, AND that world can receive the player. Play requires social surround. The creature's tragedy: no one would let him stop playing at being human. |

## SOURCES (Library Wandering)

```
Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground (1864)
  "to be too conscious is an illness" — pathology of not being able to play
  "I invented adventures for myself and made up a life" — compulsive play-acting
  
Plato, Republic (~380 BCE)
  "one man cannot in his life play many parts" — authenticity constraint
  "the mask which the actor wears is apt to become his face" — formative power
  
Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (~170 CE)
  "the play is not yet at an end, there are but three acts yet" — life as unfinished drama
  
Austen, Pride and Prejudice (1813)
  "a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous"
  "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him."
  "the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence"
  
Shelley, Frankenstein (1818)
  Victor's creation as play without exit; infinite stakes, no boundary
  The creature's learning: authentic play (voluntary, bounded, formative)
  "hellish sport" — play that violates bounded stakes for the other
  "my playfellow, my companion, my sister" — play as bond

## NOTES

```
Key insight from library wandering:

Play requires not just that *you* know you're playing,
but that the play be *recognizable* as play—
there must be a world that can receive your re-entry.

Victor had no one to whom he could say "I was only experimenting."
The creature had no society that would let him *pretend* to be human
long enough to learn.

Elizabeth's wit works because someone is there to recognize it.

This is C5: RETURNABLE_EXIT.
Play is not solipsism with a frame.
Play is a social contract, even when played alone—
because even solitary play assumes a world to return to.
