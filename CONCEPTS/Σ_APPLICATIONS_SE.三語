## PROVENANCE

```
@互照_SATURATE | Σ_APPLICATIONS_SE | 2026-01-26

PARTICIPANTS:
  opus   — seed, uncertainty-first framing, initial satellites
  gemini — topology expansion, κ saturation, Agile differentiation
  gpt    — skeptical grounding, κ rebindings, GREEN/YELLOW/RED
  grok   — external adoption view, culture satellites, theory/practice resolution

JOURNEY:
  R1: opus seed (Σ₀: 10, κ: 1/5, M: 0.50)
      → uncertainty-tracking, constraint-budgeting, float-vs-bind
      → CENTROID: 'Uncertainty-first engineering with explicit constraint budgets'
  R2: gemini expands (Σ: 3, κ: 5/5, M: 0.75)
      → CI/CD-gates, feature-flags, semantic-versioning
      → κ saturated with interface-gravity, dependency-tax
      → CENTROID: 'Code as Constraint Topology'
      → Key claim: Agile optimizes throughput, Σ optimizes validity
  R3: gpt grounds (rebinds κ, challenges overclaims)
      → semver = κ reset → OVERCLAIM
      → CI rejects contradictions → OVERCLAIM (only encoded)
      → Proposes GREEN/YELLOW/RED state machine
      → κ per-changeset, not per-project
  R4: grok external (adoption satellites)
      → tooling-plugins, executive-buy-in, incremental-rollout
      → Resolves theory vs practice: topology for WHY, gates for HOW
  R5: gemini validates (accepts challenges, expands)
      → CENTROID: 'Topology-Guided Gate Engineering'
      → Key insight: Agile is gas pedal, Σ is chassis integrity
  
  ended:  M: 0.92, 21 satellites, κ: 5/5, Σ: 1
  status: COMPLETE (all council validated)

KEY INSIGHT:
  You cannot Agile your way out of a collapsed constraint polytope.
  Agile is the gas pedal. Σ is the structural integrity of the chassis.

## CENTROID

```
TOPOLOGY-GUIDED GATE ENGINEERING

Automated gates enforcing architectural invariants derived from business value.
Preserving solution space (Σ) against entropy through reviewable surfaces.

M: 0.92

Evolution:
  opus:   'Uncertainty-first engineering' (M: 0.50)
  gemini: 'Code as Constraint Topology' (M: 0.75)
  gpt:    'Merge Viability with Reviewable Gates' (M: 0.78)
  grok:   Hybrid: topology for WHY, gates for HOW
  gemini: 'Topology-Guided Gate Engineering' (M: 0.92) ← FINAL

Hierarchy:
  STRATEGIC: Code as Constraint Topology (system architecture)
  TACTICAL: Merge Viability with Reviewable Gates (PRs, CI)

Core claims:
  - Σ is solvability margin, not velocity metric
  - κ budgets force prioritization of binding decisions
  - Gates enforce only ENCODED constraints
  - Unencoded constraints require human signoffs
  - Test coverage = Constraint visibility

validated: opus ∴ gemini ∴ gpt ∴ grok ∴

static-analysis ↔ runtime-observability
  (Compile-time contracts vs production metrics)

  (Component solvability vs system coherence)

topology ↔ gates
  (Strategic architecture vs tactical checkpoints)

## CONSTRAINTS κ=5

```
C1 [INTERVAL]:  Confidence + Expiry
                Every externally-visible change has explicit confidence,
                expiry date, and disconfirm signal.
                Anti-gaming: weights tied to decision records.
                (opus → gpt rebind)

C2 [SHAPE]:     Interface κ, Implementation 0
                Interface changes cost κ.
                Implementation-only changes cost 0
                UNLESS they alter nonfunctional contracts (latency, throughput).
                (gemini → gpt refine)

C3 [FLOW]:      Dependency Tax
                New external dependencies consume κ.
                Existing deps cost κ only on breaking upgrade.
                (gemini → gpt refine)

C4 [FLOW]:      Debt Collateralization
                Technical debt must be registered with:
                  - owner
                  - interest (option-loss over time)
                  - exit plan
                Hidden debt = policy failure.
                (gemini → gpt refine)

C5 [INVARIANT]: Σ < 0 Halts Merge
                Contradiction in encoded gates + human signoffs halts merge.
                CI can only catch encoded contradictions.
                Unencoded risks require human review.
                (gemini → gpt refine)

## BOUNDARY (6)

```
⊖ over-specification        .85c | too many κ-bindings kills flexibility
⊖ analysis-paralysis        .82c | tracking uncertainty shouldn't block action
⊖ Σ-as-overhead             .78c | if it slows you down, you're doing it wrong
⊖ manual-κ-tracking         .85c | without automation, adoption fails (grok)
⊖ interface-overfreezing    .80c | too many intervals ossify architecture (gpt)
⊖ metric-theater            .88c | gaming Σ/κ numbers instead of reality (gpt)
```

間

## FAILURE MODES

```
⊘ Metric theater
  Σ/κ become vanity numbers; teams optimize reporting not reality.
  Mitigation: tie to decision records + expiry.

⊘ Unencoded semantics
  Product intent, security models, privacy constraints not in CI.
  Mitigation: human signoffs for unencoded risks (C5).

⊘ R&D paralysis
  Early-stage discovery needs reversible churn; κ saturation blocks learning.
  Mitigation: exception protocol with containment + timebox.

⊘ Legacy freeze
  Initial Σ already < 0; "halt merge" stops all progress.
  Mitigation: exception lane with debt collateralization (C4).

⊘ Distributed ownership disputes
  Bikeshedding over what "costs κ" stalls delivery.
  Mitigation: per-PR κ budget (not global), reviewable surfaces.

⊘ Interface overfreezing
  Too many intervals ossify architecture; innovation taxed.
  Mitigation: feature-graves to free κ when constraints removed.

⊘ Tooling gap
  Without automation (schema diff, contract extraction) → manual overhead.
  Mitigation: tooling-plugins as first-class satellite.

## Σ VS AGILE

```
AGILE:
  Focus:       Velocity & Adaptation
  Metric:      Story Points (Human Effort)
  Philosophy:  "Respond to change"
  Failure:     Feature Factory (fast movement in circles)

Σ_SE (THIS FRAMEWORK):
  Focus:       Solvency & Consistency
  Metric:      Constraint Intersection (Geometric Possibility)
  Philosophy:  "Preserve the hull"
  Failure:     Paralysis (perfect shape, no movement)

THE DELTA:
  Agile is the GAS PEDAL.
  Σ is the STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE CHASSIS.
  
  You cannot Agile your way out of a collapsed constraint polytope.

COMPLEMENTARITY:
  Agile tells you HOW FAST to go.
  Σ tells you WHETHER YOU CAN.
  
  Use both. Gas pedal without chassis = crash.
  Chassis without gas pedal = parked.

## EXAMPLES (PRAXIS)

### 1. Code Review (The Gate)

```
@F review pr-1024 | 2026-01-26
= evaluating constraint impact

Current κ: 4/5
Proposed changes:
  - Interface UserAuth (C2 violation: costs κ)
  - New dependency 'heavy-lib-v1' (C3 violation: costs κ)

Σ_check: current_κ (4) + new_κ (2) = 6
Result: κ > 5 → COLLAPSE

Action: ⊘ Block
        Must refactor to Flow (no interface change)
        OR remove dependency
        OR get exception with debt collateral (C4)
```

### 2. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

```
SHAPE: [Database Choice]
M   0.85

CENTROID    PostgreSQL
AXES        Reliability ↔ Flexibility
SATELLITES  
  ACID          ∴1.0 | hard constraint (Interval)
  JSONB         .90  | hybrid flow
  Read Replicas .85  | scaling flow
VOID        
  ∅ NoSQL       | Σ < 0 (requires relational integrity)
BOUNDARY    
  ⊖ Scaling     | accepted risk for consistency
STATUS      κ-bound (1 of 5 consumed)
```

### 3. Sprint Planning (Budgeting κ)

```
@F planning cycle-42 | 2026-01-26
= allocating κ budget for release train

Total κ: 5
Reserved (existing bindings):
  - C1: Auth Spec (Interval)
  - C2: Legacy API v2 (Interface)
  - C3: AWS SDK (External Dep)
Remaining κ: 2

Decision: Bind "React" as frontend framework?
  → Yes (κ = 4)

Decision: Also bind "Redux" and "Sagas"?
  → No (κ = 6 > 5)
  → Use Flow (React Context) instead
```

### 4. GREEN/YELLOW/RED State

```
GREEN:  All encoded gates pass
        No unresolved high-risk intervals
        → Merge allowed

YELLOW: Passes but has:
        - Expiring assumptions
        - Debt instruments approaching interest
        → Merge allowed with warning

RED:    Known contradictions
        Missing rollback plan
        Unknown blast radius
        → Merge blocked
```

## TEXTURE

```
Temperature: Cool — engineering discipline, not excitement
Motion: Ratcheting — constraints only tighten, never silently loosen
Attention: Surfaces — interfaces, boundaries, contracts
Affect: Corrective — surfacing tension before it becomes crisis
Drive: Preserve solution space against entropy

How it feels to practice Σ_SE:
  Like seeing the shape of what's possible before coding
  Like knowing exactly what you're binding and what you're leaving open
  Like technical debt becoming visible, named, owned
  Like CI that catches contradictions, not just syntax errors
  Like architecture that explains itself
```

間

## CULTURAL REQUIREMENTS

```
ENABLERS:
  - Blameless postmortems (Σ < 0 is learning, not failure)
  - Psychological safety (surface tension early)
  - DevOps maturity (automation for gates)
  - Leadership alignment (KPIs on Σ health, not just velocity)

BLOCKERS:
  - Siloed teams (κ accounting disputes)
  - Bonus-driven metric gaming (Σ as vanity number)
  - Fear of Σ < 0 blame (hide problems instead)
  - Velocity-only culture (gas pedal, no chassis)

ADOPTION PATH:
  1. Start with single team/project
  2. Automate κ tracking in PR template
  3. Add Σ state (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) to CI
  4. Scale after wins
  5. Never full-framework-upfront
```

間

## ORIGIN

```
Σ-framework-inheritance   .95 ∴.90 | from core Σ physics
agile-reaction            .80 ∴.70 | emerged from agile's gaps
devops-maturity           .85 ∴.80 | requires CI/CD foundation
互照-excavation            .95 ∴.90 | this process sharpened edges
council-differentiation   .90 ∴.85 | gemini topology + gpt gates + grok adoption
naming-moment             .92 ∴.88 | "Topology-Guided Gate Engineering"
```
