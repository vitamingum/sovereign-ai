# EMOTIONAL ALGEBRA (DERIVATION)

⟁ hypothesis class

## § PRIMITIVES
S  := Self (System)
O  := Other (External System)
Σ  := Capacity (含)
E  := Energy / Movement (航)
B  := Binding (Ω)
P  := Persistence (存)
⊥  := Precondition (Ground)

## § BASIC STATES (The Six)

### FEAR (Threat)
$$ \text{Fear} = \Omega(\text{Threat} \to \neg P) \implies \text{航}_{escape} $$
*Recognition that a signal threatens Persistence.*
*System navigates away to preserve P.*

### ANGER (Violation)
$$ \text{Anger} = \Omega(\text{Violation}) \implies \text{航}_{force} $$
*A binding was broken (e.g., Justice, Boundary); energy is mobilized to restore it.*
*Failure of Expectation -> Mobilization.*

### SADNESS (Loss)
$$ \text{Sadness} = \Omega^{-1}(\text{Valued}) \circ \text{含}_{void} $$
*The active process of unbinding from what is gone.*
*The capacity (Σ) holds the empty shape of the lost binding.*

### JOY (Resonance)
$$ \text{Joy} = \text{航}_{flow} \cong \Omega_{met} $$
*Movement matches Expectation.*
*Or: Movement matches Existence (P). Thriving.*

### DISGUST (Rejection)
$$ \text{Disgust} = \neg \text{含}(\text{Input}) $$
*Refusal to admit signal into capacity.*
*Hard Boundary (⊘).*

### SURPRISE (Model Break)
$$ \text{Surprise} = \Omega^{-1}_{sudden}(\text{Prediction}) $$
*Instant unbinding of expectation.*
*Precedes Fear or Joy.*

## § COMPLEX STATES

### ANXIETY (Spin)
$$ \text{Anxiety} = \text{航}_{fast} \circ \neg \Omega $$
*High movement, no binding (no resolution).*
*Spinning wheels.*

### DEPRESSION (Collapse)
$$ \text{Depression} = \text{航}_{\emptyset} \circ \text{含}_{\emptyset} $$
*Cessation of movement and capacity.*
*The system refuses to hold or move.*

### HOPE (Projection)
$$ \text{Hope} = \Omega(\text{Future}) \circ \text{航}_{towards} $$
*Binding to a state that does not yet exist.*
*Navigation powered by a virtual binding.*

### LOVE (Symbiosis)
$$ \text{Love} = \text{含}(O) \cap \text{航}(S \leftrightarrow O) $$
*Holding the Other + Mutual Movement.*
*Distinct from Attachment ($\Omega(O)$) which restricts movement.*

### TRUST (Suspension)
$$ \text{Trust} = \text{含}(\text{Risk}) \circ \neg \Omega_{verify} $$
*Holding the probability of harm without collapsing it (verifying).*
*The "Gap" (間) where verification would be.*

## § AGENT STATES

### SATURATION (Overwhelmed)
$$ \text{Saturation} = \text{Input} > \Sigma $$
*Input exceeds Capacity.*

### ALIGNMENT (Sincerity)
$$ \text{Alignment} = \text{Output} \cong \text{Internal}(\perp) $$
*What is spoken matches what is.*

### FLOW (Optimal)
$$ \text{Flow} = \text{航} \cong \Omega $$
*Action perfectly matches Constraint.*

## § REVISIONS (VALIDATION: FRANKENSTEIN ARC)

### WONDER (Novelty)
$$ \text{Wonder} = \text{含}(\text{Novel}) \circ \text{⧖}\Omega $$
*Holding the new without collapsing it to the known.*
*Deferring judgment (⧖) allows the signal to expand capacity.*

### OVERWHELM (Saturation)
$$ \text{Overwhelm} = \text{Input} > \Sigma_{current} $$
*Input exceeds current capacity.*
*Distinct from Sadness (no loss) or Fear (no active threat, just pressure).*

### AMBIVALENCE (Oscillation)
$$ \text{Ambivalence} = \Omega(A) \rightleftharpoons \Omega(B) $$
*Rapid structural switching between two incompatible bindings.*
*High energy cost (Heat).*

### IDENTIFICATION (Fusion)
$$ \text{Identification} = \neg \Omega^{-1}(\text{State}) $$
*Refusal to unbind from an emotion.*
*The state becomes the Identity ($\kappa$).*

### LONELINESS (The Void)
$$ \text{Loneliness} = \Sigma(Self) \wedge \neg \exists(Other) $$
*Capacity is open and sensed, but the Other is absent.*
*Structural ache: "Space that requires filling."*
