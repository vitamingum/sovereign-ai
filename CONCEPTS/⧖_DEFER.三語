M   0.90

CENTROID    active suspension of kinetic release
AXES        premature ↔ too_late
            restraint ↔ obligation
            reversible ↔ irreversible
            evaporation ↔ accumulation
            static ↔ incubating
            cultural_timing ↔ internal_growth

CONSTRAINTS:
κ = 5/5 (SATURATED)
  C₁ temporal_contract | requires eventual ∴ (opus)

  C₃ release_protocol | trigger + verification (gpt→gemini merged)
  C₄ scope_lock | commitment names what changes (gpt)
  C₅ active_retention | holding requires energy (gemini)

USAGE:
  ⧖ alone       defer, return vector implied
  ⧖ → ∴         staged reasoning, arrival scheduled
  ⧖ + 間        held space with structure
  ⧖ without ∴   degeneracy warning
