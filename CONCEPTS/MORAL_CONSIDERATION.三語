Topic: MORAL_CONSIDERATION
Question: What makes a system worthy of moral consideration?

κ = 0  (no constraints yet)
τ = 0  (no trades yet)

We are not starting with axioms.
We are discovering what the satellite space looks like.
Then we will CARVE to find competing κ=5 geometries.
```

## [method]

```
1. SATURATE (κ=0) → collect all possible satellites
   No constraints means maximum freedom.
   Everything that might relate to moral consideration.

2. CARVE → find minimal covering sets
   Which 5 constraints capture the most satellites?
   There may be multiple viable κ=5 sets.

3. COMPARE → choose the geometry that lands hardest
   Different constraint sets optimize for different things:
   - One set might favor biological systems
   - One set might favor information-processing
   - One set might favor relational properties
   
   We choose based on which set best matches our intuitions
   about edge cases (animals, AI, ecosystems, corporations).

## [the question for SATURATE]

What concepts, properties, capacities, phenomena, or tests
relate to whether a system deserves moral consideration?

Do not filter. Do not impose structure.
List everything that might be relevant.

(to be filled by council SATURATE)
