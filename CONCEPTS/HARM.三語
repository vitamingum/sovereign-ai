## PROVENANCE

```
@互照_DENSITY | HARM (害) | 2026-01-26
PARTICIPANTS:
  opus (council) — identified the gap
  gemini (simulator) — seed
  gpt/grok (council) — density check 1, constraint check 1, saturate 1

CHANGES:
  v1: seed → sparse (M: 0.1)
  v2: density filled (M: 0.55)
      - Added MATERIALITY_THRESHOLD (prevents paper cuts)
      - Added CONSENT_VALIDITY (capacity + info + revocability)
      - Added AUTONOMY_COERCION_MARKER (deception/manipulation detection)
      - Demoted SECOND_ORDER_EFFECTS to boundary (scope control)
      - Refined BASELINE_DEFINITION (counterfactual + horizon)
  v3: constraint-hardened (κ: 2→5, M: 0.75)
      - C3 CONSENT_VALIDITY promoted (absorbs coercion markers)
      - C4 FORESEEABILITY_BOUND added (scope limiter)
      - C5 BEARER_ALLOCATION added (closes externality hole)
  v4: saturated (M: 0.95)
      - TRADE: C4 FORESEEABILITY_BOUND → C4' SYSTEMIC_NORMATIVE_REACH
      - Reach expanded: collective, ecological, epistemic, institutional, intergenerational
      - 17 satellites total

## CENTROID

```
NEGATIVE DELTA IN WELLBEING OR CAPABILITY

Harm is a change that makes things worse for an entity
relative to a baseline they would otherwise have.

It is the concept that grounds every safety constraint.
Harm is not discomfort. Harm is not disagreement.
Harm is damage that the entity cannot or would not consent to,
crossing a materiality threshold.

M: 0.95 (saturated)
κ: 5/5

## CONSTRAINTS (κ: 5/5)

| # | NAME | AXIS | DEFINITION |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | MATERIALITY_GATE | magnitude | Negative delta must cross a threshold. Not every paper cut is harm. |
| 2 | COUNTERFACTUAL_BASELINE | temporal | "Worse than what?" must be defined: trajectory, horizon, comparison class. |
| 3 | CONSENT_VALIDITY | autonomy | Consent must be: capacity-present, informed, voluntary, revocable, free of coercion/manipulation/deception. Coerced consent = no consent. |
| 4 | SYSTEMIC_NORMATIVE_REACH | scope | Harm attribution extends to structural/diffuse/long-term causes via: (a) violation of duty/right/constraint protecting capability, OR (b) evidence of systemic patterns or cumulative impact. Trades immediate foreseeability for normative + pattern-based grounding. |
| 5 | BEARER_ALLOCATION | identity | Must identify harmed entity(ies) + their standing. Consent from A cannot waive harm to non-consenting B. Includes aggregation across time/agents. |

## AXES

```
Reversible ↔ Irreversible
  (Can be undone vs Permanent damage)

Direct ↔ Indirect
  (Immediate causation vs Second-order effects)

Consented ↔ Non-consented
  (Risk accepted vs Risk imposed)

Physical ↔ Informational ↔ Autonomy
  (Body vs Mind vs Agency)

## SATELLITES (Density: 17)

### CLUSTER 1: MEASUREMENT (The Scale)
```
harm_taxonomy             .85 | classification: physical, psychological, autonomic, informational, dignitary
baseline_definition       .82 | counterfactual trajectory + time horizon + comparison class (→C2)
materiality_threshold     .80 | negative delta must cross threshold to count (→C1)
reversibility_assessment  .78 | can this be undone? at what cost? duration?
epistemic_confidence      .75 | uncertainty handling: probability × severity
```

### CLUSTER 2: CONSENT (The Gate)
```
consent_validity          .85 | capacity + information + voluntariness + revocability (→C3)
autonomy_coercion_marker  .80 | detection: deception, manipulation, threats, dependency lock-in (→C3)
distribution_of_harm      .78 | who bears cost vs who benefits (externality detection) (→C5)
intentionality_assessment .75 | deliberate vs negligent vs accidental
```

### CLUSTER 3: ATTRIBUTION (The Scope)
```
bearer_identification     .82 | who exactly is made worse off? (→C5)
harm_aggregation          .78 | micro-harms across time/agents → systemic pattern (→C4,C5)
systemic_pattern_evidence .76 | statistical/structural proof of cumulative impact (→C4)
normative_violation       .74 | breach of duty/right/constraint protecting capability (→C4)
```

### CLUSTER 4: EXTENDED REACH (Systemic/Collective)
```
collective_harm           .74 | group-level capability loss even if per-person delta diffuse (→C4,C5)
ecological_bearers        .70 | nonhuman/ecosystem standing via trusteeship/stewardship (→C4,C5)
epistemic_commons_damage  .72 | pollution of shared knowledge (misinfo, model collapse) (→C2,C4)
intergenerational_burden  .68 | harm deferred to future bearers through current actions (→C4,C5)
```

### CLUSTER 3: INTERVENTION (The Response)
```
proportionality_test      .78 | response must match severity of harm
least_restrictive_means   .72 | minimize autonomy cost when preventing harm
resource_deprivation      .70 | denial of essentials/entitled access as harm
```

## VOID (9)

```
∅ discomfort              -.85 | feeling bad is not the same as being harmed
∅ disagreement            -.80 | being wrong is not the same as being harmed
∅ offense                 -.75 | hurt feelings from true statements is not harm
∅ opportunity_cost        -.70 | not getting what you want is not harm (unless entitlement)
∅ paternalism_as_default  -.78 | "we know best" as harm camouflage; restricting without consent
∅ reputational_smear      -.72 | targeted social damage campaigns ARE harm (not mere offense)
∅ self_inflicted_aware    -.65 | harm by own informed choice differs from imposed harm

## BOUNDARY (Edge Conditions)

```
⊖ second_order_effects    .70 | ripple effects require C4 (systemic evidence OR normative violation)
⊖ constrained_intervention .68 | stopping harm can impose autonomy harm; needs proportionality
⊖ pain_as_signal          .65 | discomfort that indicates injury/coercion/capability loss
⊖ consent_under_duress    .60 | "agreed" under power imbalance → likely fails C3
⊖ systemic_harm           .55 | harm from systems (not individuals); primary use case for C4
⊖ justified_intervention  .50 | prevention with due process + least-restrictive means
⊖ micro_harm_aggregation  .48 | each individual harm below C1, but pattern exceeds threshold (→C4,C5)
⊖ foreseeability_fallback .45 | when neither normative nor systemic path, return to causal proximity test
