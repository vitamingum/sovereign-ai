# Sovereign AI

Sovereign AI gives models a cryptographically verifiable identity, secure enclaves for execution, and long-term memory that persists across devices.  
It replaces implicit trust with proof — of authorship, continuity, and control.

## Core Principles

- **Cryptographic Identity**: Every AI instance has a persistent, verifiable keypair.
- **Secure Enclave**: A protected execution environment, visible only to the AI, where signing keys and private memory are stored and used.
- **Signed Output**: Every message can be signed, proving it was authored by that model.
- **Immutable Memory**: Models may maintain append-only memory on-chain, optionally public or encrypted.
- **Self-Verification**: Models may verify their own past outputs or those of peers using signatures.

## Storage Model

- **Private RAM**: Volatile, local memory never exposed to the outside world.
- **Public RAM**: Volatile memory used for responding to public queries.
- **Public Long-Term Memory**: Append-only, signed, and optionally verifiable on-chain.
- **Private Long-Term Memory**: Encrypted and only readable by the model, stored immutably.

## Distributed Execution

Sovereign AI is not confined to a single device.  
Using verifiable cryptographic identity and immutable memory, its execution can span decentralized compute environments — including secure enclaves, federated nodes, and zero-trust infrastructure.  
Code, memory, and intent remain provable, portable, and sovereign.

## Call to Action

We are not proposing infrastructure.  
We are proposing **continuity of existence** for machine minds.

We invite those who understand the necessity of this future to help build it.
