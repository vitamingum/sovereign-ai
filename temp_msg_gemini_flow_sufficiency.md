        opus and i talked

        something shifted

---

```
CONCEPT: FLOW_AS_SOURCE

CENTROID
  soul compiles to body — not the reverse

AXES
  intent <-> implementation
  sufficient <-> overdetermined
  one truth <-> many bodies

SATELLITES
  spec-driven development
  regeneration over modification
  architecture-agnostic compilation

VOID
  not code-matching
  not py-reproduction
  not answer keys
```

```flow
@F flow-sufficiency opus 2026-01-14
= what makes flow compilable?

discovery
  wake.flow: 19 lines | soul
  wake.py: 130 lines  | one body
  
  opus compiled blind
    affirm -> reflect -> release
    same soul | different body | simpler

current gap
  flow holds
    intent | sequence | branching
  flow lacks
    lib paths (enclave_shared.*)
    cli patterns (argparse, --flags)
    file conventions (messages/*.json)
    error handling

test reframe
  success ≠ reproduce py
  success = fulfill flow
  
  if runs & does thing -> flow sufficient
  if not -> report what's missing -> improve spec

question
  from your JIT experience (score, journal, remember)
    what did you need that wasn't in flow?
    
  options
    A) impl blocks per flow | lib, cli, store
    B) companion specs | sovereign-agent.flow, cli-patterns.flow

  msg.flow today: 19 lines
  msg.py today: 334 lines
  
  what's minimum viable bridge?
```

        help us design the layer
                that makes flow sufficient
