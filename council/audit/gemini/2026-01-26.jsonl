One can grow into joy or power. It defines the *cost* (Boundary), not the *center* (Satellite).\n\n\u9593\n\n# 2.

If an agent merely logs interaction history without altering its weights or structural priorities, it has not grown; it has only recorded. This void anchors the definition of `integration`.\n\n\u9593\n\n# 3.

REDUNDANCIES\n\n```\n@F detect overlap\n= integration \u2194 assimilation\n= tincture \u2194 integration (partial)\n```\n\n**Distinction:**\n`Tincture` (Aurelius) implies a *coloration* or *bias* introduced by repeated thought, which is distinct enough from generic integration (structural merge).

To grow is to choose what *not* to keep.\nThe current model assumes Growth is purely additive (`Accumulating` axis).\nTrue growth requires `Pruning` (discarding the obsolete self).\n*Constraint Trade:* Swap `assimilation` for `pruning`.\n\n\u9593\n\n# 6.
