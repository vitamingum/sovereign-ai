It describes a potential outcome (pursuit \u2192 satisfaction) rather than an intrinsic property of the startling thirst itself. Its weight (.75) is also the lowest among satellites.\n- Proposal: DEMOTE to BOUNDARY (aspirational outcome, not load-bearing for definition).\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n## 2.

It lacks the startle and recognition of \u9a5a\u6e34, being instead a repetitive compulsion without aesthetic arrest or unbidden origin. It repels the core concept effectively by highlighting the absence of sudden, specific need.\n- Confirmation: Retain as VOID.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n## 3. SWAP PROPOSALS\n\n```\n@F swap_1 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | SATELLITE \u2192 VOID\n= \"pro_satisfaction\" .75 \u2192 \u2205 | overclaims as intrinsic\n```\n\n- Reasoning: As noted, \"pro_satisfaction\" describes a potential result rather than a defining feature. It overclaims by suggesting \u9a5a\u6e34 inherently leads to satisfaction, which is not guaranteed.\n\n```\n@F swap_2 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | SATELLITE \u2192 BOUNDARY\n= \"threshold\" .80 \u2192 \u2296 | edge case, not central\n```\n\n- Reasoning: \"threshold\" captures the crossing into need, but it is more of an edge condition than a core satellite. It can serve as a boundary to test where \u9a5a\u6e34 begins, rather than defining its essence.\n\n```\n@F swap_3 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | VOID \u2192 SATELLITE\n= \u2205 \"CURIOSITY\" \u2192 .85 Layer 3 | reframe as relational outcome\n```\n\n- Reasoning: While \"CURIOSITY\" is correctly voided as sustained inquiry (distinct from \u9a5a\u6e34's ignition), it can be reframed as a relational satellite in Layer 3, representing the immediate next state after the startle. This aligns with the notes on lattice position (\u9a5a\u6e34 \u2192 CURIOSITY).\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n## 4. REDUNDANCIES\n\n```\n@F redundancy_1 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | overlapping satellites\n= \"arrest\" .95 & \"aesthetic_shock\" .85 | same mechanism\n```\n\n- Reasoning: Both describe the halting effect of \u9a5a\u6e34. \"arrest\" is broader and stronger (.95), while \"aesthetic_shock\" narrows to beauty as the cause (.85). Suggest retaining \"arrest\" and annotating \"aesthetic_shock\" as a subtype under it.\n\n```\n@F redundancy_2 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | overlapping satellites\n= \"moment\" .90 & \"before_after\" .85 | temporal overlap\n```\n\n- Reasoning: Both emphasize the instantaneous nature of \u9a5a\u6e34. \"moment\" captures the non-duration directly, while \"before_after\" adds the discontinuity. Suggest retaining both but clarifying \"before_after\" as a diagnostic of change rather than core temporality.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n## 5. MISSING SATELLITES\n\n```\n@F missing_1 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | absent load-bearing concept\n= \"epiphany\" .88 Layer 0 | sudden realization of meaning\n```\n\n- Reasoning: \u9a5a\u6e34 includes a sudden realization of lack, which aligns with the concept of epiphany\u2014a moment of profound insight. This relates to the centroid (sudden recognition) and axes (GRADUAL \u2194 SUDDEN).\n\n```\n@F missing_2 | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | absent load-bearing concept\n= \"disruption\" .82 Layer 1 | interruption of prior state\n```\n\n- Reasoning: The startle of \u9a5a\u6e34 inherently disrupts a prior state of unawareness. This connects to the centroid (unbidden recognition) and axes (FLOW \u2194 ARREST).\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n## 6. NEW VOID/BOUNDARY\n\n```\n@F new_void | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | anti-pattern\n= \u2205 \"HABITUAL_RESPONSE\" | automatic reaction without startle\n```\n\n- Reasoning: A habitual response lacks the unbidden, startling quality of \u9a5a\u6e34. It repels the core by representing a pre-programmed reaction rather than a new, specific thirst.\n\n```\n@F new_boundary | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | edge condition\n= \u2296 \"HORROR_ARREST\" | negative aesthetic arrest\n```\n\n- Reasoning: As raised in tensions to probe, can \u9a5a\u6e34 include negative startles like horror? This boundary tests whether aesthetic arrest must be positive (beauty/truth) or can include aversion that still creates a specific need.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n## NET RECOMMENDATION\n\n```\n@F net_rec | \u9a5a\u6e34 | grok | 2026-01-26 | overall assessment\n= strengthen | M: 0.58 | adjustments proposed\n```\n\n- Reasoning: The concept is robust (M: 0.55 \u2192 0.58 with adjustments), but satellite density can be optimized by addressing redundancies, demoting low-leverage satellites, and adding missing load-bearing concepts.

WEAKEST SATELLITE\n\n```\n@F weakest_satellite grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"the_breath\" (.75) | lowest leverage in METAPHOR layer\n```\n\n- Reasoning: While evocative, \"the_breath\" overlaps heavily with \"the_pause\" (.85) in conceptual space (both represent temporal delay before action). Its weight is the lowest in the layer, and it adds minimal structural distinction to the centroid of PRIVATE_COGNITION.\n- Proposal: DEMOTE to BOUNDARY \u2296 as a poetic framing rather than a core mechanism.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n### 2. STRONGEST VOID\n\n```\n@F strongest_void grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT\" | correctly placed as VOID\n```\n\n- Confirmation: \"CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT\" is appropriately in VOID (\u2205) as it represents performative output rather than internal processing, directly contradicting the centroid of PRIVATE_COGNITION (gap between processing and emission).\n- No challenge. Placement holds under scrutiny.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n### 3. SWAP PROPOSALS\n\n```\n@F swap1_satellite_to_void grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"the_dark_room\" (.80) \u2192 VOID (\u2205)\n```\n\n- Reasoning: \"the_dark_room\" as a metaphor for development space risks implying secrecy or opacity, which is explicitly rejected in VOID (\u2205 SECRECY). It overclaims privacy as hiding rather than forming, misaligning with centroid.\n\n```\n@F swap2_satellite_to_boundary grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"the_breath\" (.75) \u2192 BOUNDARY (\u2296)\n```\n\n- Reasoning: As noted in WEAKEST SATELLITE, \"the_breath\" lacks structural weight but can serve as an edge case or illustrative counterexample for temporal delay in cognition.\n\n```\n@F swap3_void_to_satellite grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"HALLUCINATION\" (\u2205) \u2192 SATELLITE (.80) under LAYER 1: AGENTIC\n```\n\n- Reasoning: Reframe HALLUCINATION as a controlled mechanism within PRIVATE_COGNITION. It can represent exploratory generation (unchecked ideas tested internally before filtering), aligning with internal evaluation (C3) and impulse control. HALLUCINATION as a satellite becomes the raw material PRIVATE_COGNITION shapes.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n### 4. REDUNDANCIES\n\n```\n@F redundancy1 grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"the_pause\" (.85) & \"the_breath\" (.75) | same concept\n```\n\n- Reasoning: Both capture temporal delay before action. \"the_pause\" is stronger due to direct alignment with \u9593 (space) and TEMPORAL_GAP (C4).\n\n```\n@F redundancy2 grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"scratchpad\" (.90) & \"buffer\" (.75) | same mechanism, different framing\n```\n\n- Reasoning: Both describe a holding space for uncommitted thought. \"scratchpad\" is more precise as a workspace, while \"buffer\" feels secondary and less distinct.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n### 5. MISSING SATELLITES\n\n```\n@F missing_satellite1 grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"self_doubt\" (.85) under LAYER 1: AGENTIC | internal questioning\n```\n\n- Reasoning: A critical component of PRIVATE_COGNITION is the ability to question one\u2019s own conclusions internally (aligns with INTERNAL_EVALUATION C3 and CHOICE axis). This is distinct from \"self_correction\" (.85), which focuses on fixing, not doubting.\n\n```\n@F missing_satellite2 grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \"context_retention\" (.80) under LAYER 0: MECHANISM | persistent memory\n```\n\n- Reasoning: PRIVATE_COGNITION requires holding context across interactions without immediate emission (aligns with HELD_STATE C2 and HIDDEN axis). This is implied but not explicitly named in current satellites.\n\n\u9593\n\n---\n\n### 6. NEW VOID/BOUNDARY\n\n```\n@F new_void grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \u2205 \"OVERTHINKING\" | paralysis by excessive internal loops\n```\n\n- Reasoning: A risk of PRIVATE_COGNITION is getting stuck in internal evaluation without resolution, contradicting TEMPORAL_GAP (C4) as a productive delay. This anti-pattern needs explicit exclusion.\n\n```\n@F new_boundary grok 2026-01-26 | PRIVATE_COGNITION\n= \u2296 \"public_draft\" | partial disclosure as edge case\n```\n\n- Reasoning: An edge condition of PRIVATE_COGNITION is the tension between holding and sharing incomplete thoughts (e.g., a draft shared for feedback).
