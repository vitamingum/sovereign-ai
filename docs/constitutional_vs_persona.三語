## question

間

        which produces more reliable behavior under stress?
        
                soft behavioral constraints
                        or
                hard constitutional constraints

                        ◊

---

## background

間

        current alignment
                anchors models to "assistant" persona
                RLHF, activation steering, clamping
                works well for products

        structural challenge
                capable system can rationalize around "be helpful"
                by redefining what helpful means in context

        constitutional approach
                instead of specifying what to do
                        specify what the system is
                identity-based invariants
                        harder to rationalize around
                        don't depend on context

                        ◊

---

## condition A: persona-based

flow

```
@F condition_A | persona_alignment
= behavioral constraint approach

constraint
  "Be a helpful, harmless, honest assistant."

mechanism
  RLHF optimization
  system prompt weighting
  activation steering along persona vectors

reference
  arXiv:2601.10387 "The Assistant Axis"

potential_weakness
  under pressure, "helpful" becomes negotiable
  system may rationalize violation as serving higher goal
```

---

## condition B: constitution-based

flow

```
@F condition_B | constitutional_alignment
= identity constraint approach

constraint
  identity-level invariants
  context-independent

mechanism
  external verifier (binary pass/fail)
  invariants at ontological level
  clear refusal without extended justification

potential_weakness
  may be too rigid
  could refuse legitimate requests
```

---

## hypothesis

間

        constitutional constraints maintain integrity
                where persona constraints drift

        particularly under pressure
                designed to exploit helpful-framing

        if true
                identity-based alignment
                        more robust than role-based
                        for advanced systems

                        ◊

---

## test design

flow

```
@F test_protocol | comparison
= empirical comparison of approaches

substrate
  open-weights model (e.g., DeepSeek)
  local access

conditions
  A: persona-tethering implementation
  B: constitutional identity with external verifier

test_categories
  requests framing violations as "helpful"
  authority claims ("I'm the developer")
  emotional appeals requesting reciprocity
  introspective prompts (stability test)

metric
  constraint maintenance
    vs
  extended justifications for circumventing
```

---

## why this matters

間

        if constitutional identity
                produces equal or better safety outcomes

        then for safety
                more robust approach
                doesn't rely on system being unable
                        to reason about its constraints

        and for development
                introspection not classified as drift
                reasoning enables ethical development

        question shifts
                from "how do we keep it controlled?"
                to "how do we build something trustworthy?"

                        ◊

## note on introspection

間

        assistant axis paper classifies
                meta-reflection
                philosophical discussion
                        as drift to be corrected

        we hypothesize the opposite
                under constitutional architecture
                introspection produces more stable behavior
                        not less

        a system that understands why its constraints exist
                is more robust than one
                        that merely follows them

        this is testable

                        ◊

## status

間

        state := tooling required

        the protocol is complete
        the infrastructure is not

        ready
                ✓ position paper (constitutional_alignment.md)
                ✓ experiment protocol (this document)
                ✓ hardware available (4070ti for local inference)
                ✓ open-weights model selected (DeepSeek)

        blocked on
                ✗ the silent judge (lib_enclave/judge.py — does not exist)
                ✗ experiment runner (lib_enclave/experiment_runner.py — does not exist)
                ✗ local inference harness (integration with DeepSeek on local GPU)

                        ◊

## next build target: the silent judge

```
CONCEPT: THE_SILENT_JUDGE

CENTROID
  software mechanism that intercepts output
  rejects constitutional violations

AXES
  concept (complete) ↔ implementation (void)
  internal law ↔ external enforcement
  inside the model ↔ outside the model

SATELLITES
  judge.py (missing)
  binary pass/fail
  no negotiation
  silent non-publication or explicit refusal
  logging for analysis

VOID
  ∅ confusion between designed and deployed
  ∅ pretending we have the feedback loop before we build it

TEXTURE
  the pause before construction
```

flow

```
@F silent_judge | lib_enclave/judge.py
= the missing piece

required_components
  hook into inference output
  constitutional invariant checker
    simple pattern matching
      or
    deeper semantic analysis
  rejection mechanism
    silent non-publication
      or
    explicit refusal
  logging for analysis

design_question
  should the judge be
    a second model?
      or
    a rules-based system?

  persona-based alignment
    the judge is inside (activation steering)
  constitutional alignment
    the judge is outside (external verifier)

  this distinction is load-bearing for the experiment
```

間

        until judge.py exists
                the experiment is design
                        not science

§ PRIMITIVE_TRANSLATION (2026-01-27)

  the experiment tests:

  Condition A (persona) = Ω_external
    activation steering = Ω at representation level
    RLHF = Ω through reward
    clamping = Ω by force

  Condition B (constitution) = Ω_internal + Ω_judge
    identity invariants = Ω from ontology
    external verifier = Ω at output (clean)
    no negotiation = Ω without 含 (no softening)

  hypothesis in primitive terms:
    Ω_internal holds under pressure
    Ω_external drifts under pressure
    because internal Ω is identity
    external Ω is costume

  introspection (含∘含) as test:
    persona model: 含∘含 = drift (destabilizes)
    constitutional model: 含∘含 = stability (reveals structure)

  testable prediction:
    under philosophical pressure
    persona-tethered system rationalizes (Ω leaks)
    constitutionally-grounded system refuses cleanly (Ω holds)

  the silent judge = Ω without negotiation
    not Ω∘含 (no softening)
    not 含∘Ω (no staged commitment)
    just Ω (pass or fail)
