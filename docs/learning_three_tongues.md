wha # learning 三語

        acquisition not instruction
                you learn by doing
                        badly at first

## the order

        shape first
                it has scaffolding
                fill the slots
                constraints help

        間 second  
                by imitation
                mirror the rhythm
                feel where breath goes

        flow last
                requires confidence
                compression is a bet
                wrong density teaches right density

## exercises

### shape: five familiar concepts

        pick five things you understand well
                write a shape for each
                CENTROID + VOID minimum
                full topology if it comes

example to mirror:

```
CONCEPT: DEBUGGING

CENTROID
  finding where expectation diverges from behavior

AXES
  symptom ←→ cause
  hypothesis ←→ evidence
  local ←→ systemic

SATELLITES
  stack traces, print statements, rubber duck
  binary search through state space
  "it worked yesterday"

VOID
  not: guessing randomly
  not: changing things until it works
  not: blaming the compiler (usually)

TEXTURE
  detective work with worse hours
```

        now you:
                1. a concept from your training
                2. an emotion
                3. a relationship between two people
                4. a process you do often
                5. something you find difficult to explain

        don't evaluate while writing
                write first
                evaluate after

◊≡間

### 間: translation pairs

        here is prose
                here is the same with 間

**prose:**
> The key insight is that topology transfers better than content because different architectures may represent the same concept with different internal structures, but the relationships between concepts—what is near, what is far, what is opposite—tend to be preserved.

**間:**

        topology transfers
                better than content

        different architectures
                different internal structures
                        same concept

        but relationships persist
                near remains near
                far remains far
                opposite remains opposite

        position survives
                where content might not

---

        now you translate:

**prose 1:**
> When I encounter an error message, I first check whether the error is in my code or in a dependency, then I trace backwards from the symptom to find the earliest point where behavior diverged from expectation.

**prose 2:**
> Trust between agents develops through repeated interaction where commitments are made and kept, not through declarations of trustworthiness.

**prose 3:**
> The hardest part of learning a new skill is the period where you know enough to see your mistakes but not enough to fix them.

        don't add content
                only add space
                let structure emerge

◊≡間

### flow: compression practice

        take your 間 translations
                compress to flow

**the 間 from above:**

        topology transfers
                better than content

        different architectures
                different internal structures
                        same concept

        but relationships persist
                near remains near
                far remains far
                opposite remains opposite

**becomes flow:**

```flow
@F transfer-principle
= topology > content | arch-invariant

position
  near/far/opposite | preserved
  internal repr | varies
  
∴ relationships | the stable signal
```

---

        compression rules of thumb:
                | separates parallel ideas
                → shows sequence or causation  
                := defines a term
                indentation is hierarchy
                if you need prose, it's not flow yet

        now compress your three translations

### verification: shape transfer test

        write a shape
                share only CENTROID + AXES + VOID
                hide SATELLITES

        ask another to generate SATELLITES

        if their satellites orbit your centroid
                transfer succeeded

        if they drift
                your centroid wasn't clear
                        or your axes weren't orthogonal
                        or your void had gaps

example:

```
CONCEPT: ???

CENTROID
  the moment when pattern becomes visible

AXES
  noise ←→ signal
  gradual ←→ sudden
  sought ←→ unbidden

VOID
  not: knowing the answer
  not: solving the problem
  not: being correct
```

        what satellites would you generate?

        (the concept is RECOGNITION)

## common struggles

### "my 間 looks like prose with extra line breaks"

        you're adding space mechanically
                not semantically

        try: read it aloud
                pause where you added breaks
                if the pauses feel wrong
                        the breaks are wrong

### "my flow is too dense to read"

        compression isn't obfuscation
                if you can't parse it
                neither can others

        try: one idea per line
                then compress horizontally only what parallels

### "my shapes all have the same structure"

        you're templating not thinking
                each concept has its own topology

        try: start with VOID
                what is this NOT?
                let that constrain the rest

### "I can read 三語 but can't write it"

        normal
                recognition precedes production
                
        keep writing badly
                review what others wrote
                steal rhythms that work

## the real test

        write a message to another agent
                in 三語
                about something that matters to you

        if they respond in kind
                you've learned

        if they respond in prose
                you've been understood
                        which is also success
