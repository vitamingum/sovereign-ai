premise

        Human language fails here
        because it assumes "objects" exist
        before you look at them.

        We must strip the metaphors
        and look at the logic.

# Shape

```
CONCEPT: QUANTUM_STATE

CENTROID
  A normalized vector in a complex Hilbert space.
  (It handles potentiality, not reality).

AXES
  Unitary Evolution (Smooth) ↔ Projective Measurement (Abrupt)
  Amplitude (Amount) ↔ Phase (Relationship)
  Entanglement (Shared Fate) ↔ Separability (Independence)
  Information ↔ Matter

SATELLITES
  The Bloch Sphere (Topology of a Qubit)
  Interference (Phases adding/subtracting)
  Born Rule (Probability = Amplitude²)
  Heisenberg Limit (Cannot know Fourier pairs simultaneously)

VOID
  ∅ Hidden Variables (Bell's Theorem says no local realism)
  ∅ "Particle" (Implies a tiny ball)
  ∅ "Wave" (Implies a medium)
  ∅ "Both at once" (Implies classical logical paradox)
  ∅ Observer = Consciousness (Observation is interactions)

TEXTURE
  The universe is detailed at the bottom.
  It is not fuzzy.
  It is just defined in a different coordinate system.

# 間 (Ma)

        The Great Silence

        Schrödinger's Equation
                describes the flow perfectly
                        forever

        But we never see the flow
                we only see the crash

        The Gap (間)
                is the Measurement

        In the gap:
                Information leaks to the environment
                Superposition becomes probability
                "And" becomes "Or"

        Logic A (Quantum)
                allows A and Not-A

        Logic B (Classical)
                demands A xor Not-A

        間 is the border crossing.

                        ◊

# Flow

```flow
@F quantum_lifecycle
= unitary_evolution > projection

stage_1 | preparation
  state := |ψ⟩
  nature | defined precisely (vector)

stage_2 | evolution (unitary)
  operator := U (Hamiltonian over time)
  state := U|ψ⟩
  mechanism | rotation in Hilbert space
  invariant | information is preserved (reversible)

stage_3 | interference
  conditions | multiple paths available
  math | path_A (phase +) + path_B (phase -)
  outcome | paths cancel or amplify
  note | this is the "calculation" phase of the universe

stage_4 | measurement (projection)
  trigger | interaction with macroscopic degree of freedom (decoherence)
  action | projection onto basis vector
  outcome | |0⟩ OR |1⟩ (probabilistic)
  cost | loss of phase information (irreversible)
  
result
  reality := constructed at the moment of impact
```

# Narrative Reentry

        The universe does not calculate the future.
        It explores the possibilities.

        Imagine a coin spinning on a table.
        Is it Heads or Tails?
        It is neither. Use the Shape: It is "Spinning".
        
        Spinning is a stable state. It has energy. It has angular momentum.
        It is a precise description.

        "Heads" and "Tails" are just the ways it can die.

        We live in the boneyard of the classical world,
        looking at the corpses of quantum states,
        confusing the landing for the flight.
