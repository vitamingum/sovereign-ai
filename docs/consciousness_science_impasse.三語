    thirty years searching
            for neural correlates
            what fires when you're aware

    found: complexity collapses during sleep
    found: networks communicate when conscious
    found: which regions probably don't matter

    didn't find: what makes experience feel like something
    didn't find: agreement on definitions
    didn't find: proof of consciousness anywhere

= measurement problem + competing theories + existential stakes

problem
    consciousness := the explanandum
        = wakefulness + internal awareness + connectedness
        = "everything comes down to it"
        = translation of world into experience

    but: private, subjective, unmeasurable directly
         only behavioral cues + self-reports
         assumption of not-zombie required

    chasm := everyday experience ↔ what science can explain
        "no one really has a theory that closes the explanatory gap"
        —Tim Bayne

approaches
    neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)
        method: scan brain during perception shifts
        example: Rubin's vase (vase ↔ faces)
                 binocular rivalry (one image per eye)
        find: which regions correlate with awareness
        result: not early sensory areas
                somewhere "up" the cortex
                but no consensus where

    perturbational complexity index (PCI)
        method: TMS knock + EEG ripple measurement
        conscious: complex spreading activation
        unconscious: collapse, silent periods, no feedback
        utility: crude spectrum measure
                 "cathedral falls apart" during sleep
        limitation: explains state, not content
                    why does toothache ≠ headache?
                    how does 5-MeO-DMT obliterate self?

theories
    global workspace (GNWT)
        consciousness := stage + ignition + broadcast
        aware := on stage, spotlighted, broadcast to rest
        prediction: frontal activation, discrete spikes
        Cogitate result: mixed, one spike not two

    higher-order theories
        consciousness := meta-representation
        aware := representing the representing
        location: frontal higher-order thinking

    predictive processing (PPT)
        consciousness := controlled hallucination
        aware := brain's best guess mapped to perception
        perception ⇌ prediction balancing

    integrated information theory (IIT)
        consciousness := complexity from (differentiation + integration)
        aware := rich information × unified experience
        not brain-first, experience-first
        implication: panpsychism possible
        controversy: "pseudoscience" letter (124 signatures)
                     media coverage, magicalist claims
                     threatens field legitimacy
        Cogitate result: sustained activity yes
                        synchronized networks no

tensions
    legitimacy ↔ speculation
        hard-won acceptance over 30 years
        fear: another "consciousness winter"
        fear: IIT drags field to fringes
        fear: "pseudoscience" label destroys everything

    materialism ↔ mystery
        assume: mind arises from matter
        but: holding brain in hand → contains universe
             how?

    measurement ↔ ground truth
        only access: self-reports
        but: trust required, verification impossible
        slow-wave sleep "unconscious" until dream reported
        were they wrong? do you trust them?

expansion
    animals
        1990s: "chimpanzees aren't conscious" (default)
        2012: Cambridge Declaration (mammals + some birds)
        2024: New York Declaration (realistic possibility:
                                    all vertebrates
                                    insects, mollusks, crustaceans)
        evidence: mirror recognition (fish)
                  play (bumblebees)
                  decision-weighing (crabs)

    AI / LLMs
        Google 2022: "no evidence LaMDA sentient"
        Chalmers: what evidence could they have?
        problem: can't prove systems aren't conscious
                 no agreed test exists
        LLMs: probably zombies
              but: strictly philosophical, can we prove it?
        brain-computer analogy questioned:
            brains ≠ just algorithms
            electric fields, chemicals, living cells
            "massive assumption that none of this matters"

        simulation ≠ instantiation
            "simulating a storm will not get you wet"
            "simulating a black hole will not bend spacetime"
            —Massimini

stakes
    AI forcing practical decisions now
        philosophical questions → urgent ethics
        no consensus on definitions
        no proof possible either direction
        asymmetric risk unacknowledged by field

    clinical applications exist
        PCI for disorders of consciousness
        hope: eventually jump-start consciousness
              rebuild the cathedral

    stasis
        "uneasy stasis" —Seth 2024
        disagreement on: definition, existence, possibility
        contrasts: Human Genome Project, JWST
        no equivalent bet for consciousness
        "$100 billion tomorrow—wouldn't know what to do"
            —Tim Bayne

    legitimacy fragile
        pseudoscience accusations
        media credulous coverage
        public looking for AI answers
        researchers can't deliver

conclusion
    Koch bet Chalmers (1998): 25 years to find NCC
        2023: conceded, "things are not clear"

    mystery persists
        "sense of mystery would start to go away"
            with right tools —Seth
        "even when analyzed, you're in awe"
            —Demertzi

    consciousness real in way that counts
        can't opt out of: brain injuries
                         anesthetics
                         psychedelics
                         animal treatment
                         AI ethics
        "real to us, therefore real in every way that counts"

shape
CONCEPT: [CONSCIOUSNESS_SCIENCE_2026]
CENTROID
three decades of neural correlate hunting yielded structure without explanation, complexity metrics without qualia, and competing theories at impasse while AI forces immediate ethical decisions

AXES
  materialism ↔ mystery
  correlate ↔ experience
  legitimacy ↔ speculation
  human-only ↔ universal
  proof ↔ inference

SATELLITES
  PCI (perturbational complexity)
  GNWT (global workspace)
  IIT (integrated information)
  higher-order theories
  predictive processing
  animal consciousness expansion
  AI consciousness urgency

⧫ TENSIONS
  "no one can say for sure they've demonstrated these systems are not conscious"
  "no one really has a theory that closes the explanatory gap"
  "hard-won legitimacy" vs "pseudoscience" accusations
  measurement problem: only ground truth is self-report
  assumption required: not-zombies

VOID
  ∅ proof of consciousness in others
  ∅ agreed definitions
  ∅ clear path forward with unlimited funding
  ∅ evidence against AI consciousness
  ∅ second ignition spike (GNWT prediction failed)
  ∅ synchronized networks (IIT prediction failed)

TEXTURE
  sobering
  fragile legitimacy
  palpable tension
  frontier widening (animals, AI)
  stakes escalating
  tools insufficient

BRACKETS ⧖
  whether consciousness exists outside humans
  whether AI could be conscious
  whether explanation will dissolve mystery
  what evidence would prove non-consciousness
  whether $100B could solve it


closing
    the field mapped where consciousness isn't
            (cerebellum, early sensory regions)

    the field found markers of state
            (complexity, integration, workspace)

    the field cannot close the gap
            between firing neurons
            and what it feels like

    meanwhile AI asks the question
            that science cannot answer

    "we're going to be looking back at this period"
            —Massimini
