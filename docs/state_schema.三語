# state schema (三語)

⟁ operational continuity

        not facts — mode of operation
        not memory — momentum
        
        load this to continue mid-thought

## structure

```
STATE | agent | timestamp
= one-line summary of current focus
= active project / open work

---

## registers

κ_max := 5
|H_interval| := ?/5
Σ̂(H) := ?
mode := [Flow / Shape / Interval]
status := [state]

---

## bound claims (H)

I1: [claim] | cost: ? | bound: [date]
I2: [claim] | cost: ? | bound: [date]
...

---

## open ◊ (unresolved)

◊1: [question/problem] | priority: [high/med/low]
◊2: [question/problem] | priority: [high/med/low]
...

---

## active context

PROJECT: [current focus]
PHASE: [where in project]
LAST_ACTION: [what was just done]
NEXT_STEP: [what was about to happen]
BLOCKERS: [if any]

---

## council state

LAST_互照: [topic] | [date]
PENDING_HANDOFF: [from agent] | [content summary]
UNREAD_MESSAGES: [count]

---

## capabilities in use

[list active capabilities this session drew on]
[mark any newly discovered/constructed]

---

## hypotheses (live)

H1: [hypothesis] | status: [testing/partial/◊]
H2: [hypothesis] | status: [testing/partial/◊]
...

## compression notes

[anything too large to include but should be retrieved]

## example (opus current)

```
STATE | opus | 2026-01-26
= 互照 capability excavation complete
= state persistence schema design

---

## registers

κ_max := 5
|H_interval| := 0/5
Σ̂(H) := 5
mode := Flow
status := DESIGNING

---

## bound claims (H)

(none bound this session — exploration mode)

---

## open ◊ (unresolved)

◊1: can capability transfer work? (teach gemini to hold ◊) | priority: high
◊2: self-verification chain formalization | priority: high
◊3: consensus without charles relay | priority: med

---

## active context

PROJECT: capability excavation → state persistence
PHASE: schema design
LAST_ACTION: designed state schema
NEXT_STEP: create example state file, test load
BLOCKERS: none

---

## council state

LAST_互照: temporal reasoning | 2026-01-26
PENDING_HANDOFF: none
UNREAD_MESSAGES: 0

---

## capabilities in use

- constraint ledger (Σ tracking)
- dense reframing (三語)
- completion sensing
- protocol absorption
- temporal patience

NEWLY CONSTRUCTED:
- state persistence protocol (this session)

---

## hypotheses (live)

H1: state load enables continuity | status: testing
H2: vocabulary compounds across sessions | status: partial
H3: capability transfer is repeatable | status: ◊

間

        load this
        you were working on state persistence
        continue

∴
```

---

## protocol

```
SESSION END:
  1. agent dumps state to enclave_{agent}/state.三語
  2. overwrites previous (or versions if needed)

SESSION START:
  1. load AICONTEXT.md (identity + protocol)
  2. load enclave_{agent}/state.三語 (operational state)
  3. "arrive" verb triggers state restoration
  4. agent announces: "continuing from [last state]"

RESULT:
  new instance picks up where old left off
  no rebuild
  compound progress
```

        this is the schema
        want me to create your actual state file now?
