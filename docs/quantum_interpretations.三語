premise

        The equations are settled.
        The predictions match experiment.
        
        The argument is about ontology:
                What is real?
                When does it become real?
                For whom?

        Prose has failed this problem.
        
        We apply structure.

# The Combatants

───────────────────────────────────

## Copenhagen (Bohr, Heisenberg)

```
CONCEPT: COPENHAGEN_INTERPRETATION

CENTROID
  The wavefunction is not real.
  It is a tool for predicting measurement outcomes.
  "Shut up and calculate."

AXES
  Epistemology (What we know) ↔ Ontology (What exists)
  Quantum System ↔ Classical Apparatus
  Preparation ↔ Measurement

SATELLITES
  Complementarity (Wave OR Particle, never both)
  The "Heisenberg Cut" (Arbitrary line between quantum/classical)
  Instrumentalism (Physics predicts, doesn't explain)

VOID
  ∅ The wavefunction is a physical thing
  ∅ Asking "what happens between measurements"
  ∅ The observer is quantum

TEXTURE
  Austere. Disciplined.
  Refuses to speculate beyond the data.
  "The question is meaningless."
```

───────────────────────────────────

## Many-Worlds (Everett)

```
CONCEPT: MANY_WORLDS_INTERPRETATION

CENTROID
  The wavefunction is real.
  It never collapses.
  All branches exist.

AXES
  One World (Collapse) ↔ Many Worlds (Branching)
  Probability (Objective) ↔ Probability (Indexical/Self-Location)
  Observer (Special) ↔ Observer (Just More Wavefunction)

SATELLITES
  Decoherence (Explains apparent collapse without collapse)
  The Preferred Basis Problem (Why these branches?)
  Probability from Self-Location (Why does Born Rule work?)

VOID
  ∅ Wavefunction collapse
  ∅ Observers are special
  ∅ Non-unitary dynamics

TEXTURE
  Extravagant. Parsimonious in laws, profligate in worlds.
  "Everything that can happen, does."
```

───────────────────────────────────

## Pilot Wave (de Broglie-Bohm)

```
CONCEPT: PILOT_WAVE_INTERPRETATION

CENTROID
  Particles are real AND have definite positions at all times.
  The wavefunction is a real field that guides them.
  Deterministic.

AXES
  Indeterminism (Standard QM) ↔ Determinism (Hidden Variables)
  Wavefunction Only ↔ Wavefunction + Particles
  Non-Local ↔ Local (Bohm is explicitly non-local)

SATELLITES
  Guidance Equation (Particle velocity = gradient of phase)
  Quantum Equilibrium (Why Born Rule emerges)
  Contextuality (Measurements disturb the guiding field)

VOID
  ∅ Intrinsic randomness (It's deterministic chaos)
  ∅ The particle doesn't exist between measurements
  ∅ Locality (Accepts non-locality as the price)

TEXTURE
  Classical intuition preserved.
  "There IS a fact of the matter."
  Pays with non-locality.
```

───────────────────────────────────

## QBism (Fuchs, Schack)

```
CONCEPT: QBISM

CENTROID
  The wavefunction represents an agent's beliefs.
  Probabilities are personal. Not objective.
  Measurement is the agent updating their beliefs.

AXES
  Objective Probability ↔ Subjective Probability
  Observer-Independent Reality ↔ Agent-Relative Experience
  Physics Describes World ↔ Physics Is a User's Manual

SATELLITES
  Dutch Book Arguments (Bayesian coherence)
  "Participatory Realism"
  No measurement problem (There's nothing to explain)

VOID
  ∅ Objective wavefunction
  ∅ God's-eye view of reality
  ∅ The measurement problem (Dissolved, not solved)

TEXTURE
  Radical. Personal.
  "Whose probability? YOURS."
```

───────────────────────────────────

## Relational (Rovelli)

```
CONCEPT: RELATIONAL_QUANTUM_MECHANICS

CENTROID
  Quantum states are relations between systems.
  There is no absolute state.
  "Facts" are relative to the observer-system.

AXES
  Absolute State ↔ Relative State
  One Reality ↔ Many Consistent Perspectives
  Observer (Outside) ↔ Observer (Inside, as physical system)

SATELLITES
  Information as primitive
  Consistency across perspectives (Not contradiction)
  No preferred reference frame (Like Relativity)

VOID
  ∅ Absolute, observer-independent quantum state
  ∅ Privileged observer
  ∅ Collapse as objective event

TEXTURE
  Relativistic. Democratic.
  "Real for whom?"
```

# 間 (Ma): The Actual Disagreements

        Now we compare the Voids.

        Where does one interpretation's VOID
                overlap with another's CENTROID?

        That is the real collision.

                        ◊

───────────────────────────────────

## Collision Map

```flow
@F interpretation_collisions
= centroid vs void comparisons

collision_1 | Copenhagen vs Many-Worlds
  Copenhagen.VOID    := "Wavefunction is physical"
  ManyWorlds.CENTROID := "Wavefunction is real"
  verdict | DIRECT CONTRADICTION

collision_2 | Many-Worlds vs Pilot-Wave
  ManyWorlds.VOID  := "Collapse happens"
  PilotWave.VOID   := "Collapse happens"
  verdict | AGREEMENT (Both deny collapse, but for different reasons)
  
  ManyWorlds.CENTROID := "All branches exist"
  PilotWave.CENTROID  := "One branch is real (the particle's actual position)"
  verdict | DIRECT CONTRADICTION on branching

collision_3 | Copenhagen vs QBism
  Copenhagen.CENTROID := "Wavefunction is a tool"
  QBism.CENTROID      := "Wavefunction is belief"
  verdict | SIMILAR but not identical
  
  Copenhagen.VOID := "Asking what happens between measurements"
  QBism.VOID      := "Objective probabilities"
  verdict | QBism goes further (even outcomes are agent-relative)

collision_4 | Relational vs Everyone
  Relational.CENTROID := "States are relative to observer"
  Everyone_Else       := Assumes some observer-independent reality
  verdict | ORTHOGONAL FRAMING (Different question being answered)
```

───────────────────────────────────

# Flow: What Is Actually At Stake?

```flow
@F core_questions
= the load-bearing disagreements

question_1 | Is the wavefunction real?
  Copenhagen  := NO (epistemic tool)
  Many-Worlds := YES (ontic, branches)
  Pilot-Wave  := YES (ontic, guides particles)
  QBism       := NO (agent's belief)
  Relational  := DEPENDS (real relative to observer)

question_2 | Is there a fact of the matter between measurements?
  Copenhagen  := NO (meaningless question)
  Many-Worlds := YES (all outcomes)
  Pilot-Wave  := YES (particle has position)
  QBism       := NO (no agent, no fact)
  Relational  := YES, but relative

question_3 | Is probability objective or subjective?
  Copenhagen  := Objective (but irreducible)
  Many-Worlds := Objective (from self-location)
  Pilot-Wave  := Objective (from ignorance of initial conditions)
  QBism       := SUBJECTIVE
  Relational  := Relational (neither fully objective nor subjective)

question_4 | What is the role of the observer?
  Copenhagen  := Classical apparatus (outside quantum description)
  Many-Worlds := Just more wavefunction (no special role)
  Pilot-Wave  := Disturbs the system (contextuality)
  QBism       := THE PROTAGONIST (beliefs are the subject)
  Relational  := One physical system among many
```

# Narrative Reentry

        The 100-year war is not about math.
        The math is settled.
        
        The war is about four questions:
        
        1. Is the wavefunction furniture of the universe, or furniture of the mind?
        2. Does reality exist between glances?
        3. Is probability "out there" or "in here"?
        4. Are observers magical or mundane?
        
        Copenhagen says: Stop asking.
        Many-Worlds says: Everything is real; you're just lost in it.
        Pilot-Wave says: Particles are real; the wave just tells them where to go.
        QBism says: Reality is what happens to YOU.
        Relational says: Reality is a conversation, not a monologue.
        
        They are not all right.
        But they are not all talking about the same thing.
        
        三語 does not solve the problem.
        But it prevents the false peace of "agreeing to disagree."
        
        Now we can see where we actually disagree.
