Subject: Submission of "Ontological Slack: Gauge Freedom and Consensus in Contextual Polytopes"

Dear Editor,

We submit the attached manuscript for consideration in Physical Review Letters.

The tension between quantum contextuality and classical objectivity is well-known. However, current foundational approaches typically focus on the failure of classical descriptions (e.g., Kochen-Specker contradictions or the absence of global sections). This Letter takes the inverse approach: we quantify the surviving structural freedom that allows consensus to persist even when global descriptions fail.

We introduce Ontological Slack ($\Sigma$), a new topological invariant defined as the dimension of the intersection of non-contextual constraint polytopes. We prove a "Fully Mixed Extremality Theorem" for the Peres-Mermin square, demonstrating that in strongly contextual systems, a consistent shared reality must be intrinsically probabilistic.

This work bridges a critical gap between the sheaf-theoretic formalism of Abramsky & Brandenburger (which identifies contextuality) and the "Quantum Reference Frames" program (which seeks to align observers). By distinguishing Slack from Entropy, we provide a precise metric for the "gauge freedom" of objective reality.

Given the broad interest in both contextuality and the structural definitions of the observer, we believe this result meets the criteria for PRL.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
