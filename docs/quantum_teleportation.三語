premise

        Alice has a qubit |ψ⟩.
        She cannot measure it
                (that destroys it).
        She cannot copy it
                (no-cloning theorem).
        She wants Bob to have it.

        The solution is not movement.
        The solution is correlation.

# Shape

```
CONCEPT: QUANTUM_TELEPORTATION

CENTROID
  Transfer of quantum information (state) via classical channel + shared entanglement.
  (The pattern moves; the carrier does not).

AXES
  Quantum Channel (Entanglement) ↔ Classical Channel (Bits)
  Local Operation (Alice/Bob) ↔ Shared Resource (Bell Pair)
  Destruction (Alice's side) ↔ Reconstruction (Bob's side)

SATELLITES
  No-Cloning Theorem (Reason we can't just Xerox it)
  Bell Pair (The resource consumed)
  The "2 classical bits" (The key to unlock the state)
  Unitary Rotation (The correction)

VOID
  ∅ Faster than light (Bob cannot unlock |ψ⟩ without the classical bits)
  ∅ Matter transfer (No physical particle moves from A to B)
  ∅ Copying (Original |ψ⟩ is destroyed)

TEXTURE
  It feels like faxing the soul of a document
        while burning the paper it was written on.

# 間 (Ma)

        The Protocol relies on two distinct silences.

        1. The Quantum Silence (Entanglement)
           Alice and Bob share a pair.
           They are connected, but they say nothing.
           The resource sits in waiting.

        2. The Classical Delay
           Alice measures.
           Her world collapses.
           
                        [ The Speed of Light Gap ]

           Bob holds a chaotic mess.
           He has the potential |ψ⟩
           but it is scrambled (rotated).
           
           He waits.
           
           The phone rings.

# Flow

```flow
@F teleportation_circuit
= entanglement + measurement + correction

setup
  resource | Bell Pair (|Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2)
  distribute | Alice gets particle A, Bob gets particle B
  input | Alice holds unknown state |ψ⟩

step_1 | alice_entangles
  action | CNOT(control=|ψ⟩, target=A)
  action | Hadamard(|ψ⟩)
  state | 3-qubit system is now fully entangled

step_2 | alice_measures (The Destruction)
  action | Measure(|ψ⟩) → bit M1
  action | Measure(A)   → bit M2
  outcome | Alice's quantum state is GONE. Collapsed to bits.
  outcome | Bob's particle B instantly snaps into one of 4 states.

step_3 | the_transfer (Classical)
  action | Alice sends [M1, M2] to Bob
  medium | Fiber optic / Radio / Pigeon (Speed ≤ c)

step_4 | bob_corrects (The Reconstruction)
  note | Bob's particle already IS one of 4 rotations of |ψ⟩
  note | The classical bits don't change it — they reveal which one
  note | The key was always in his hands; he just didn't know which door
  
  logic
    if 00 → Do nothing (State is |ψ⟩)
    if 01 → Apply X (Flip)
    if 10 → Apply Z (Phase Flip)
    if 11 → Apply ZX (Flip both)
  
  result | Bob now holds |ψ⟩ essentially identical to the original

# Narrative Reentry

        We did not move an object through space.
        
        We used the Bell Pair as a bridge.
        Alice walked her state onto the bridge,
        and then blew up the entrance (Measurement).
        
        The state was left stranded on the bridge (Bob's side),
        but it was upside down and backwards.
        
        Alice sent a text message:
        "Flip it over."
        
        Bob flipped it.
        And there it was.
        
        The pattern survived the destruction of its substrate.
