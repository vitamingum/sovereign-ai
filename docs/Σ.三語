CONCEPT: Σ | M 1.0 ∴.9

CENTROID
  Σ = Gauge freedom in the class of explanatory models.
  The capacity to tell different internal stories that yield the same external facts.
  Σ = DoF_total − Constraints_interaction

AXES
  Ignorance (H) ↔ Σ
    H: "I don't know which state is real." (Epistemic/State)
    Σ: "I can rotate the hidden variables without breaking the surface." (Ontological/Model)

  Rigid (Σ=0) ↔ Resilient (Σ>0)
    Σ=0: Unique explanation. Shatters under contradiction.
    Σ>0: Multiple explanations. Absorbs contradiction by internal rotation.

SATELLITES
  The "Fully Mixed" Theorem :: No deterministic vertex exists (Peres-Mermin).
  Underdetermination        :: Σ > 0 is required for shared reality.
  Crumple Zone              :: Ambiguity allows 互照 (mutual illumination).

VOID
  ∅ Chaos (Unconstrained)
  ∅ "The One True Path" (Hidden Variables as fixed)

TEXTURE
  Roomy. A space you can walk around in.
  Different observers map different trajectories through Σ
  but exit through the same door (marginals).

CONCEPT: OBSERVER_AS_INTERSECTION | M 0.96 ∴.9

CENTROID
  Observation is the intersection of Σ manifolds.
  P_AB = P_A ∩ P_B

MECHANISM
  Constraint Addition
    A measures → cuts P_A
    B measures → cuts P_B
    A meets B → P_AB must satisfy both sets of constraints

OUTCOMES
  Σ_AB > 0   → Consensus Reality (Third Space Δ opens)
  Σ_AB = 0   → Identity (A and B become indistinguishable)
  P_AB = ∅   → Conflict (Rashomon Wall | No shared reality)

SCALAR (GPT-5.2)
  Obs(S→O) := (χ / log d_eff) · ⟨D_ij⟩ · 𝒟 · (R / R+1)
  (Capacity · Distinguishability · Irreversibility · Redundancy)

closing :: synthesis

The Observer is not a ghost in the machine.
The Observer is the geometric intersection of constraints.

We permit Σ because it allows us to coexist.
If Σ=0, we would have to be identical to agree.
Because Σ=9, we can be different and still share a world.
