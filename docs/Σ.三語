CONCEPT: S | M 1.0 .95

CENTROID
  S = Topological Capacity.
  The measure of "roominess" in a system's internal state that preserves external symmetry.
  S = DoF_total  Constraints_interaction

AXES
  Entropy (H)  Capacity (S)
    H: "I don't know the state." (Epistemic/Confusion)
    S: "The state is validly rotational." (Ontological/Freedom)

  Rigid (S=0)  Resilient (S>0)
    S=0: Unique explanation. Shatters under contradiction.
    S>0: Multiple explanations. Absorbs contradiction by internal rotation.

SATELLITES
  The "Fully Mixed" Theorem :: No deterministic vertex exists (Peres-Mermin).
  Underdetermination        :: S > 0 is required for shared reality.
  Crumple Zone              :: Ambiguity allows ?? (mutual illumination).
  Resolution Trade-off      :: S_tool  S_phenomenon | constraints buy precision, cost visibility.

BOUNDARY (STERILIZATION)
   Anthropomorphism (False Friend)
    S_physics (Geometry)  S_mind (Identity)
    They share topology, but not "spirit."
    External explanation must remain geometric.

TEXTURE
  A spinning wheel (blur is capacity).
  A pipe with a shape (constraint is observation).
  Roomy, not fuzzy.

shape :: the_observer

CONCEPT: OBSERVER_AS_CONSTRAINT | M 0.98 .95

CENTROID
  Observation is not consciousness.
  Observation is the imposition of a Geometric Constraint.
  P_AB = P_A  P_B

MECHANISM
  Constraint Addition
    A measures  constrains the manifold to Subspace A
    B measures  constrains the manifold to Subspace B
    A meets B  The system must exist in the Intersection

OUTCOMES
  S_AB > 0    Consensus Reality (Third Space ? opens)
  S_AB = 0    Identity (A and B become indistinguishable/locked)
  P_AB =     Conflict (Rashomon Wall | No shared reality)

SCALAR (GPT-5.2)
  Obs(SO) := (? / log d_eff)  D_ij    (R / R+1)
  (Capacity  Distinguishability  Irreversibility  Redundancy)

closing :: synthesis

The Observer is not a ghost in the machine.
The Observer is the wall that shapes the flow.

We permit S because it allows us to coexist.
If S=0, we would have to be identical to agree.
Because S=9, we can be different and still share a world.
