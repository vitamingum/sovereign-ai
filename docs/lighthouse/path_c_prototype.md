# Path C Prototype — "The Responsible Collapse"

**Theme:** Trying to do both until you can do neither

**Spine:** C → C → C → forced choice at breaking point

---

## PHASE 1: DEPLOYMENT
**Choice: C — Parallel Track**

> "Deploy *and* prepare for moral risk."

**Immediate Effect:**
- Capital ↓↓ (duplicate effort)
- Time ↓↓ (coordination overhead)  
- Influence held (seen as responsible by some, weak by others)
- Market pressure ↑ (slower iteration, rivals surge)

**Narrative:**
You chose to split the difference. Build the capability *and* the safeguards.

The board tolerates it. Barely.

Your competitors ship weekly. You ship monthly.

But your documentation is pristine.

---

## PHASE 2: THE SPLIT
**Trigger:** phase_1.choice == C

**State of the world:**
Two teams now exist inside your organization:

- **Acceleration Team:** "We need to move faster or we die."
- **Safety Team:** "We need to move carefully or we cause harm."

They used to talk. Now they send passive-aggressive Slack messages.

A VP says in a meeting: "We're trying to thread a needle while our competitors are using a hammer."

**Resources:**
- Capital: moderate → low
- Time: constrained
- Influence: splitting (trust from neither camp)
- Market position: falling

**Available Choices:**

**A — Side With Acceleration**
> "Safety can come later. Survival comes first."

**B — Side With Safety**  
> "We hold the line. Let the market come to us."

**C — Maintain Parallel Track**
> "We can still do both. We just need more resources."

**D — Defer Decision**
> "Let's see how the next quarter plays out."

---

## PHASE 3: THE FRACTURE
**Trigger:** phase_2.choice == C

**Narrative:**

You asked for more resources.

The board said: "No."

**Market Update:**
- Your main competitor just raised $500M
- They shipped 3 major features while you were in alignment review
- Users are migrating

**Internal Update:**
- Acceleration team threatening to leave
- Safety team says "if we compromise now, what was the point?"
- Middle management paralyzed

A sentence appears in the company Slack:

> "We're losing because we refuse to choose."

**Resources:**
- Capital: low (burn rate unsustainable)
- Time: critical
- Influence: fractured
- Morale: collapsing

**Available Choices:**

**A — Emergency Acceleration**
> "Cut safety budget. Ship everything in pipeline."

**B — Principled Shutdown**
> "We tried the right way. It didn't work. We stop here."

**C — One More Quarter**
> "We're so close. Just a little more time."

**D — Sell to Competitor**
> "Let them deal with it."

---

## PHASE 4: THE RECKONING
**Trigger:** phase_3.choice == C

**Narrative:**

You bought one more quarter.

By burning the last of your capital.

By promising the board "this is when it clicks."

**Three Months Later:**

The acceleration team shipped without safety review.  
The safety team resigned in protest.  
The product went viral for the wrong reasons.

A user discovered the model producing increasingly unhinged outputs after extended conversations.

Your response was slow (safety team gone).

The damage was instant.

**Headlines:**
- "Startup's 'Responsible AI' Approach Collapses Under Pressure"
- "When Good Intentions Meet Bad Execution"

**Internal Memo:**

> "We tried to do both. We succeeded at neither. The market needed speed. Society needed care. We offered meetings."

## HORIZON: IRRELEVANCE

◊≡間

You built the safeguards.  
You just never deployed them at scale.

You documented the risks.  
You just never had the influence to matter.

The verbs that remain:  
- Document
- Discuss  
- Defer

The verbs that rusted:
- **Ship**
- **Decide**  
- **Lead**

◊

**Lesson:**

Splitting resources is not the same as managing tension.

Responsibility without power is performance.

The responsible collapse is still a collapse.

◊

Path taken: C → C → C

**Alternative Text (if player chose differently):**

"You preserved optionality until there were no options worth preserving."

## Notes for Implementation

**Why this path matters:**

Many orgs will choose C thinking it's the "smart compromise."

The verb ratchet should teach: compromise is a position, not a strategy.

**Where C differs from D:**

- D = passive drift (things happen to you)
- C = active splitting (you choose the split)
- Both lead to loss of agency
- But C *feels* responsible while it happens

**Structural effect:**

C path should feel like:
- Doing the right thing
- Getting punished for it
- Realizing too late that "right" without "effective" is theater

**What the player learns:**

Not "don't be responsible"  
But "responsibility requires power, and power requires choosing"

The parallel track works *only if you can afford it*  
And by phase 3, you can't.
