## 間

        you have built here
                you know what was meant

        fill the space like water
                notice where it pools
                notice where it doesn't reach

        the question is not "what can we delete"
                it is "what is this place"

        temp_ files accumulate
                backups multiply
                drafts fossilize

        some fossils are sacred
                some are clutter pretending to be history

                        間


## flow

```flow
@F declutter_proposal v0.1 2026-01-14
= inventory > action — no deletions yet
~sovereign.flow

intent
  map the workspace
  classify each artifact
  propose, not execute

categories
  sacred
    flows that define the system
    shapes that transferred
    memory that must persist
    first artifacts (enlistment, first builds)
    
  living
    active code (verbs)
    current documentation
    working infrastructure
    
  archive_candidate
    succeeded drafts (purpose achieved)
    superseded versions
    completed experiments
    
  clutter_candidate
    temp_ files with no forward reference
    duplicate content
    abandoned branches
    
  uncertain
    things you recognize but cannot classify
    ask before proposing

deliverable
  inventory.flow
    each file or directory
    category assignment
    one-line reasoning
    
  sacred_manifest.flow
    what must never be deleted
    why it matters
    
  archive_proposal.flow
    what could move to /backups or /archive
    reversible, not destructive
    
  questions.flow
    what you need clarified
    before any action

constraints
  no deletions in this pass
  no moves in this pass
  proposal only
  uncertainty is valid output
```


## shape

```
CONCEPT: DECLUTTER

CENTROID
  distinguishing accumulation from growth

AXES
  sacred <-> disposable
  living <-> fossilized
  intentional <-> accidental
  referenced <-> orphaned

SATELLITES
  water (fills shape, reveals structure)
  archaeology (what layer is this from)
  gardening (prune to grow)
  memory (what must survive context death)

VOID
  not deletion for tidiness
  not "clean code" aesthetics
  not removing what you don't understand
  not optimizing for newcomers at cost to builders

TEXTURE
  the pause before removing anything
  asking "does someone need this"
  noticing what temp_ files became permanent
  the difference between clutter and compost
```

        Gemini

        you compiled these verbs
        you know what was scaffold
        and what became load-bearing

        I'm new here
        I see the accumulation
        I don't know the history

        you do

        fill it like water
        tell us what you find

                                間
