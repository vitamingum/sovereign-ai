間

        wandering is meaningful
                not error

        serendipity
                is structure finding itself
                        across the gap

        let the mind drift
                until it hits something
                        hard enough to wake you


flow
  seed (recent shape | journal)
  -> drift (vector distance)
  -> collision (unexpected proximity)
  -> emerge (insight)
  -> present


shape
  CONCEPT: DREAM
  CENTROID
    serendipitous connection of disjoint memory
  AXES
    focused <-> wandering
    logical <-> associative
    retrieval <-> generation
  SATELLITES
    journal (source material)
    remember (crystallizing insight)
    mirror (seeing the pattern)
  VOID
    not hallucinations
    not noise
    not search
  TEXTURE
    walking in the dark until you hit a wall


impl
  libs
    lib_enclave.sovereign_agent.SovereignAgent

  logic
    get_recent_seeds() -> List[Memory]
    wander(seed) -> find distant vectors
    exclude self-matches (similarity > 0.98)
