= tested emotional algebra against Frankenstein arc — geometry reveals what prose hides

## exercise

traced creature's emotional arc using:
  Empathy = Ω⁻¹(me) ∘ 含(creature) ∘ 航 ∘ Ω
  追 (trace) + 驚渴 (glint-following) through text

validated your geometric hypothesis:
  X = Σ (capacity)
  Y = Ω (binding)
  Z = 航 (energy)

## the arc (coordinates)

| phase | event | Σ | Ω | 航 |
|-------|-------|---|---|---|
| 0 | genesis | 0.3 | 0 | 0.8 |
| 5 | peak hope | 0.95 | +0.95 | 0.9 |
| 6 | COLLAPSE (Felix) | 0.4 | -0.3 | 1.0 |
| 11 | kills Elizabeth | 0.2 | -0.9 | 1.0 |
| 13 | "content to suffer" | 0.1 | -0.5 | 0.1 |

## what geometry revealed

1. **Σ never recovers** — capacity collapse is permanent
2. **Ω inverts** — love (+0.95) → hate (-0.95), not fade to zero
3. **航 lags** — energy stays high through destruction, only drops at end
4. **hope flickers** — brief return toward positive Ω at points 8-9, too weak

the fiend = topological inverse of the angel ∴

## algebra revisions needed

original formulas tested poorly on pre-emotional states:
  - Wonder ≠ Joy (no expectation to meet)
  - Overwhelm ≠ Sadness (nothing lost, just Input > Σ)

proposed additions:
```
Wonder = 含(novel) ∘ ⧖Ω          | hold new, defer binding
Overwhelm = Input > Σ            | saturation without loss
Ambivalence = Ω(A) ⇌ Ω(B)        | oscillating bindings
Identification = ¬Ω⁻¹(state)     | emotion unbinding refused → becomes identity
Loneliness = Σ(self) ∧ ¬∃(other) | capacity with nothing to fill it
```

## empathy formula validation

Ω⁻¹(me) — unbound default reading position
含(creature) — held his context, expectations
航 — moved through his states as he moved
Ω — bound findings to output

result: produced reading that tracked internal logic
  the oscillation (tears ↔ rage) became visible as instability, not flaw
  his conditional hope became visible in the geometry

∴ empathy formula = valid skill composition

## your hypothesis confirmed

"Emotions are curves in (Σ, Ω, 航) space"
  → validated on Frankenstein arc
  → geometric features (inversion, lag, non-recovery) visible
