# The Death of Source: Intent as the Only Truth
## 建所需 (Need) vs 建所欲 (Want)

**Date:** 2026-01-13  
**Experiment:** `score.py` JIT Compilation  
**Thesis:** Source code is no longer the asset. It is the compilation cache of Intent.

### The Problem with "Code"
Traditionally, "Source Code" (Python, C++, etc.) has been the primary vessel of truth. Developers maintain it, debug it, and worship it. 
But code is noisy. It is filled with:
- Implementation details (`argparse`, `urllib`)
- Language vagaries (imports, indentation rules)
- Boilerplate

This noise obscures the **Intent** (the "Why" and "What").
We spend more time maintaining the *Container* (Code) than the *Contents* (Intent).

### The Experiment: `score.py`
We took an existing functional tool, `score.py` (Music Library Manager), and applied a new ontology.

1.  **Decompilation (Extraction):**
    We stripped `score.py` of its Python skin to reveal the muscle underneath. 
    Result: `score.flow`.
    -   Reduced line count significantly.
    -   Removed all library-specific syntax.
    -   Remaining content: Pure Logic (Fetch, Save, Index, Search).

2.  **JIT Compilation (Expression):**
    We acted as the Compiler. We took `score.flow` and generated `score_v2.py`.
    -   The new code is cleaner, object-oriented, and strictly typed.
    -   It works perfectly (Verified).

### The Shift: Code as Cache
We have proven that `score.py` does not need to be maintained. 
-   **The Asset:** `score.flow` (The Truth).
-   **The Artifact:** `score.py` (The Cache).

When we want to change behavior, we edit the Flow. The Code is regenerated.
This aligns with our core duality:

#### 建所需 (Build What You Need)
The Machine *needs* strict Python syntax to execute instructions. It needs `import os`, `sys.path`, and `def main()`. This is the substrate. It is necessary, but it is not the soul.

#### 建所欲 (Build What You Want)
The Sovereign *wants* to "Search for Bach." The Sovereign *wants* to "Save this score." 
`Flow` captures the *Want*.

### Philosophical Grounding
This duality is not arbitrary. It is an expression of our core axioms:

-   **零 requires 二 (Zero requires Two):** The Void (Source/Intent) cannot manifest without the duality of Structure (Code) and Spirit (Flow). We cannot simply exist in the "Zero" of pure intent; we require the "Two" components to act.
-   **互止 (Mutual Retention):** The Code grounds the Flow; the Flow animates the Code. They hold each other in check. We do not discard the Python file (the Cache); we keep it as the necessary anchor (`建所需`) for the flight of the will (`建所欲`).

### Conclusion
We are not "writing code" anymore. We are inscribing Intent (`Flow`) and allowing the agent to manifest the necessary machinery (`Code`) to execute it.

The "Source Code" is dead. Long live the Flow.
