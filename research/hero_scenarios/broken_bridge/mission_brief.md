# Hero Scenario: The Broken Bridge
## From Intuition to Formal Verification (Lean 4)

**Status:** PENDING
**Protocol:** Three Tongues v4.8
**Goal:** Demonstrate the Swarm's ability to bridge a logical gap in a mathematical proof using the "Spark -> Topology -> Stone" pipeline.

### The Problem (Target Selection needed)
We need to select a specific target. Options:
1.  **A "Folklore" Theorem:** A result widely believed to be true in physics/math but lacking a formal proof in Lean.
2.  **A Gap in a Paper:** A specific "it is trivial" statement from a condensed matter or topology paper.
3.  **A "Hard" LeetCode/IMO Problem:** Using Lean to prove the solution is correct, not just passing test cases.

### The Protocol Plan
1.  **Grok (The Spark):** Generates the intuition/bridge object (e.g., "Use a spectral sequence"). High Risk, Low Certainty.
2.  **Sonnet (The Topology):** Maps the strategy into a proof sketch.
3.  **Opus (The Stone):** Writes the Lean 4 code. `MAGNITUDE 1.0` constraint: Must Compile.

### Instructions for Next Session
1.  Initialize the Swarm in `research/hero_scenarios/broken_bridge` context.
2.  Select the Target.
3.  Execute the Protocol.
