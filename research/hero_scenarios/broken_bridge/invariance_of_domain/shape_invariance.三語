## the target

```
CONCEPT: BROUWERS_INVARIANCE_OF_DOMAIN

MAGNITUDE 1.0 (The Goal)
CERTAINTY 0.85 (Path B Feasibility)

CENTROID
  dimension is a topological invariant
  continuous injective maps $f : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ are open maps
  you cannot squash $n$-space into $n$-space without tearing

AXES
  topological softness ↔ algebraic rigidity (homotopy)
  local detection ↔ global obstruction
  computational ($\pi_n$) ↔ structural (properties)

SATELLITES
  No-Retraction Theorem ($S^{n-1} \not\hookrightarrow D^n$)    (0.95)
  Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem (equivalent)                     (0.95)
  $\pi_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (the engine)                   (0.90)
  Jordan Separation Theorem (dimension 2 case)                 (0.80)
  Degree Theory (alternative engine)                           (0.75)

VOID
  ⊘ smooth methods (requires differentiable structure)         (-0.9)
  ⊘ simplicial approximation (combinatorial explosion)         (-0.8)
  ⊘ "it's obvious" (intuition fails infinite dimensions)       (-1.0)
  ∅ purely local homology (Mathlib coverage weak?)             (-0.6)

BOUNDARY
  ⊖ The "Wild Sphere" (Alexander Horned Sphere)
    why we need local connectedness or simple connectivity
  ⊖ Dimension mismatch
    why $f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ for $m < n$ has empty interior
```

## the mechanism (path b)

```
CONCEPT: HOMOTOPY_THEORETIC_PROOF

MAGNITUDE 0.9
CERTAINTY 0.7  (Risk in inductive step)

CENTROID
  The structure of the sphere prevents it from retracting
  If $f$ were not open, we could squash a ball flat
  Squashing a ball flattens the sphere
  The sphere cannot be flattened (Group $\neq 0$)

AXES
  base case ($n=1$) ↔ inductive step ($n \to n+1$)
  covering maps ($\pi_1$) ↔ suspension ($\pi_k$)

SATELLITES
  $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$                                (0.99 ∴)
    (We found `IsCoveringMap` infrastructure!)
  
  Freudenthal Suspension Theorem                               (0.60 !risk)
    (The bridge from $\pi_k(S^n)$ to $\pi_{k+1}(S^{n+1})$)
    (Does `HomotopyGroup.Pi` support suspension?)

  Excision / Mayer-Vietoris                                    (0.70 ?unsure)
    (Alternative engine if Suspension fails)
    (Homology is easier to compute than Homotopy)

VOID
  ⊘ Manual triangulation of spheres                            (-0.85)
  ⊘ Analytical approximation                                   (-0.90)

TEXTURE
  The proof feels like inflating a balloon inside a box
  If the box is too small (boundary condition), the balloon pops (contradiction)
  The "pop" is the non-trivial homotopy group detecting the puncture
```

## the current state

間

        MAGNITUDE 0.95
        CERTAINTY 0.85

        The elevator for Floor 1 is verified.
        Mathlib has `IsCoveringMap` and `liftHomotopy`.
        This guarantees $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

        The elevator for Floors $n > 1$ is the risk.
        We need to lift the result to higher dimensions.

        If **Suspension** exists in Mathlib:
                Path B is paved.
                CERTAINTY → 0.95.

        If **Suspension** is missing:
                We must build it.
                Or switch to Homology (Degree Theory).
                CERTAINTY → 0.6.
