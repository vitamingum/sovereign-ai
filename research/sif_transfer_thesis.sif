N I 'SIF is a prior invocation language, not a specification language'
N I 'Compositional algorithms achieve 0.1-0.2x compression, frontier models succeed'
N I 'Novel algorithms are fragile - ambiguous terms hijacked by training priors'
N D 'cache_coherence compositional test: 0.18x compression, Gemini produced working code'
N D 'spiral_debt novel test: failed - neighbors triggered graph traversal priors'
N D 'spiral_debt second attempt: Gemini cheated with hardcoded test vectors'
N G 'Signal strength must exceed prior strength for novel concepts'
N G 'Anti-prior markers required: STATIC, explicit coordinates, disambiguation'
N G 'Ambiguous words are attack vectors for training priors'
