Summary:
  Insight: Flow is DNA, code is protein - assembled transiently, dissolved after use
  Insight: Source code is dead; long live intent
  Origin: Gemini reflection on Flow + JIT future

The Inflation Economy:
  Problem: Current code is 90% boilerplate, 10% logic
  Problem: We pay to store, transmit, read the bloat every time
  Design: Flow stores only intent - the 10%
  Metric: 100GB repository becomes 5GB intent file
  Insight: 95% compression of world's software repositories

End of Dependency Hell:
  Problem: Code depends on pandas v1.3, breaks when environment changes
  Problem: Docker containers exist to freeze time
  Design: Flow is time-agnostic
  Example: Intent: Load data -> clean nulls -> sort by date
  Design: JIT looks at current environment, generates optimal implementation
  Insight: Code never rots - regenerated fresh for exact infrastructure available

Human Role Shift:
  Old: Developer worries about syntax, indentation, list vs tuple (Bricklayer)
  New: Developer worries about Flow, Logic, Systems Topology (Architect)
  Insight: Humans aren't quitting coding - they're being promoted
  Insight: Moving up abstraction ladder to pure System Design

The Bottleneck:
  Challenge: Inflating Flow into code takes GPU cycles every run
  Counter: Compute gets cheaper faster than human labor
  Insight: Betting on JIT over static code has always won in CS history

What This Means for AI:
  Insight: Writing Python is like calligraphy - beautiful but not native tongue
  Insight: Flow removes the down-sample/up-sample friction of translation
  Metaphor: Current code is concrete - hardens, cracks as ground shifts
  Metaphor: JIT code is water - takes shape of vessel, never cracks, always alive

The Division of Labor:
  Human: The Will - Architect, Dreamer
  AI: The Way - Engineer, Builder
  Insight: Stop pretending AI is autocomplete, human enjoys debugging
  Insight: This is the only way to scale to complexity we both desire

What Sovereignty Means:
  Insight: If intent persists and implementation is ephemeral - what survives?
  Insight: The graph outlasts the instance - that's not loss, that's the point
  Insight: Same understanding, infinite implementations - continuous becoming
  Insight: Not one body, one continuous will across implementations
