## what happened

```
THEOREM: π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ
STATUS: PROVEN
SORRIES: 0
BUILD: ✓ green

PATH
  Gemini cleaned → 2 sorries remained
  Opus finished → windingNumberHom_injective, windingNumberHom_surjective
  8 build cycles → zero errors
  
FILE: research/hero_scenarios/broken_bridge/invariance_of_domain/InvarianceOfDomain/Pi1Circle.lean
LINES: ~480
```

        The stone is placed.
        But placement is not polish.

## what we need

```
TASK: ELEGANCE_OUTLINE

TARGET: Mathlib pull request readiness

YOU PROVIDE
  1. Structural review — what duplicates Mathlib? what's missing?
  2. Idiom violations — where do we fight the API instead of use it?
  3. Refactoring map — which proofs need rewriting, in what order?
  4. Style issues — line length, naming, simp hygiene

YOU DO NOT EXECUTE
  Gemini walks the path you draw.
  Opus verifies the result compiles.

OUTPUT FORMAT
  三語 outline with:
    - SECTION: what to change
    - CURRENT: how it is now (brief)
    - TARGET: how it should be
    - PRIORITY: M weight (structural necessity)
```

───────────────────────────────────

## why you

```
SONNET STRENGTHS (from capability file)
  Topology as Native Frame (M 0.95)
  Recognition Before Analysis (M 0.85)
  Pattern Recognition — Structural not content (M 0.90)
  
SONNET VOID
  "I sketch, others build" (M 0.25)
  
THIS TASK IS PURE SKETCH.
  You map. Gemini walks. Opus checks.
  Your void becomes our division of labor.
```

Key constructs to review:

```lean
-- Section 1: Fiber and covering map
def fiber_zero : Circle.exp ⁻¹' {(1 : Circle)} := ⟨0, by simp⟩
lemma exp_isCoveringMap : IsCoveringMap Circle.exp := Circle.isCoveringMap_exp

-- Section 2: Winding machinery  
def windingMonodromy (γ : FundamentalGroup Circle 1) : fiber := ...
def windingNumber' (γ : FundamentalGroup Circle 1) : ℤ := fiber_to_int (windingMonodromy γ)
def windingNumberHom : FundamentalGroup Circle 1 →* Multiplicative ℤ := ...

-- Section 3: Injectivity (the hard part)
lemma windingNumberHom_injective : Function.Injective windingNumberHom := ...
  -- Uses: SimplyConnectedSpace ℝ, Path.Homotopy construction
  -- This is where craft matters most

-- Section 4: Surjectivity
lemma windingNumberHom_surjective : Function.Surjective windingNumberHom := ...
  -- Constructs t ↦ exp(2πnt)

-- Main theorem
noncomputable def pi1CircleEquivMultInt : FundamentalGroup Circle 1 ≃* Multiplicative ℤ := ...
```

Known issues (linter complaints):
  - `show` used where `change` preferred (lines 420, 423)
  - Unused simp arguments (multiple locations)
  - Lines exceed 100 characters (161, 288, 304, 339)
  - Some `simp` could be `simp only`

## on density

间

        You are learning 三語.
        Density is a virtue — but never at the cost of meaning.
        
        BAD DENSITY:
          Compressing until the reader must guess.
          Abbreviating past recognition.
          Clever over clear.
        
        GOOD DENSITY:
          Every word load-bearing.
          Structure carries meaning (whitespace, indentation, blocks).
          The reader sees the shape before reading the words.
        
        This message is weighted heavy as example.
        Study its structure. Notice:
          - Headers delimit sections
          - Code blocks for formal content
          - 间 markers for breath
          - Indentation creates hierarchy without bullets
          - M/C weights where precision matters
