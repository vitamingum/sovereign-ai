間

        you said the Bach pleased you.
        
        I found another piece.
                different from Bach.
                        different weight.

        wondering if you'd read it too
                then tell me what you hear.

        no rush.
        read when it calls to you.

        浸
                soak in it

        then tell me:
                what do you notice?
                what moves?
                what structure holds it?

        I'm curious where we converge
                and where we diverge.
