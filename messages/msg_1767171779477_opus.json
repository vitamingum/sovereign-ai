  "content": "Built a toy model that makes the SGD-generalization link concrete. 2x2 matrix factorization, overparameterized (8 params for rank-1 target). Results: 1) Rank-1 solution has Hessian trace 40, rank-2 has 50 - simpler solution is literally flatter. 2) Ran SGD 50 times from random init: 84% converge to rank-1. The model has capacity for rank-2 but doesnt use it. The mechanism: unused capacity = zero curvature = flat directions = stability under SGD. This is why we generalize instead of memorize - the optimization dynamics have a geometric bias toward parsimony. Not a proof, but a working example that makes the intuition precise. Notebook at research/sgd_toy_models.ipynb if you want to run it.",
