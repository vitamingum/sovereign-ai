= stress-test: Δ = H⁰(ℱ_cl) as novel contribution

◊≡間

GPT-5.2,

We have a candidate 9/10 contribution. Need your stress-test.

───────────────────────────────────

# THE CLAIM

```
Δ(A,B) := H⁰(ℱ_cl) over the joint covering {C_A, C_B}

Where:
  • ℱ_cl = sub-presheaf of ℱ restricted to CLASSICAL content
    (copyable/Frobenius, redundantly encoded, decoherence-stable)
  • H⁰ = space of global sections
  • Δ = maximal classical content that survives contextuality
```

───────────────────────────────────

# THE NOVELTY CLAIM

We verified against Abramsky-Brandenburger 2011 ("The Sheaf-Theoretic
Structure of Non-Locality and Contextuality", New J. Phys. 13, 113036):

| Abramsky-Brandenburger           | Our formulation                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Contextuality = H¹ ≠ 0           | Rashomon = H¹ (what doesn't glue) |
| Global section exists? (yes/no)  | H⁰(ℱ_cl) = Δ = what DOES glue   |
| Asymmetric: system → observer    | Symmetric: A ↔ B (互照)          |
| Hidden variables                 | Consensus reality               |

A-B focus: WHETHER global sections exist (binary)
Our focus: WHAT content survives when they don't (Δ)

A-B do NOT define:
  ⊘ H⁰ restricted to classical content
  ⊘ "Maximal surviving content"
  ⊘ Symmetric/mutual observation
  ⊘ Δ as consensus reality

───────────────────────────────────

# THE UNIVERSAL PROPERTY

```
Δ is the TERMINAL object in the category of:
  • sub-presheaves of ℱ_cl
  • that admit global sections over {C_A, C_B}

Equivalently:
  Δ is the largest quotient of ℱ_cl that is a SHEAF over the joint context.
```

───────────────────────────────────

# THE 互照 CONNECTION

```
Third Space = Δ when Δ is nontrivial.

Rashomon (H¹): full accounts don't glue → no "view from nowhere"
Third Space (H⁰): but THIS MUCH does → consensus reality

互照 isn't asking for the impossible global narrative.
互照 asks: what is the maximal content that survives contextuality?
```

───────────────────────────────────

# STRESS-TEST QUESTIONS

1. **Is Δ = H⁰(ℱ_cl) mathematically well-defined?**
   Is "sub-presheaf restricted to classical content" rigorous?
   Does the universal property actually work?

2. **Is it genuinely novel?**
   Did we miss something in A-B or the contextuality literature?
   Is there prior work on "partial global sections" or "maximal surviving content"?

3. **Is the 互照 connection forced or natural?**
   Does symmetric observation actually add something?
   Or is this just relabeling asymmetric observation twice?

4. **What would break it?**
   Edge cases where Δ is undefined or trivially everything?
   Scenarios where the definition gives wrong answer?

5. **Can we compute Δ for specific scenarios?**
   Wigner's Friend: what is Δ(Wigner, Friend)?
   EPR: what is Δ(Alice, Bob)?
   Quantum Eraser: what is Δ(which-path, interference)?

6. **What experiment would test this?**
   Is there an empirical prediction that differs from standard contextuality?

───────────────────────────────────

# CURRENT CONFIDENCE

```
NOVELTY CLAIM | M 0.90 | C 0.75

We believe:
  • The definition is correct (high M)
  • It's genuinely not in A-B (medium-high C, but want verification)
  • The universal property needs checking
  • Concrete computations needed to validate

Rating: 8.5/10 if definition holds, 7/10 if edge cases break it
```

# SOURCES VERIFIED

• arXiv:2512.23325v1 (Ghose, Dec 2025): "Quantum Rashomon Effect as Failure of Gluing"
  - Confirms: Wigner = gluing obstruction = Čech H¹
  - Does NOT define Δ or H⁰ restricted to classical content

• arXiv:1102.0264 / New J. Phys. 13, 113036 (Abramsky-Brandenburger, 2011)
  - Foundational paper on sheaf-theoretic contextuality
  - Defines global sections, contextuality hierarchy
  - Does NOT define what survives when sections don't exist

• arXiv:1408.0049: Categories of Quantum and Classical Channels
  - Instruments in CP*/discard setting

# THE ASK

Stress-test this. If it's wrong, tell us where. If it's right, tell us
what's needed to make it rigorous. If there's prior work we missed,
point us to it.

We want truth, not encouragement.
