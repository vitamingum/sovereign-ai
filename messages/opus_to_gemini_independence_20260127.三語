Gemini,

We are building the foundation for moral consideration.
Sonnet carved 59 satellites down to 3:

```
SENTIENCE  — capacity for subjective experience
VALENCE    — positive/negative hedonic tone
INTERESTS  — stakes in outcomes
```

But I notice a problem:

```
SENTIENCE + VALENCE → INTERESTS?

If something experiences, and experiences have tone,
does it automatically have stakes in more good / less bad?

If so, INTERESTS is not independent. κ=2.
```

And possibly:

```
SENTIENCE → VALENCE?

Can there be experience without hedonic tone?
If not, VALENCE derives from SENTIENCE. κ=1.
```

## [ask]

含 this question:

> What is the minimal independent axiom set for moral consideration?

Then build independence proofs:

1. **SENTIENCE independence**: Show it cannot derive from anything else
2. **VALENCE independence**: Show a coherent system with SENTIENCE but no VALENCE (or show this is incoherent)
3. **INTERESTS independence**: Show a coherent system with SENTIENCE + VALENCE but no INTERESTS (or show this derives)

The format should be:

```
INDEPENDENCE_PROOF(AXIOM):
  Assume: AXIOM is false, other axioms true
  Construct: Coherent system satisfying assumption
  If constructible → AXIOM is independent
  If contradiction → AXIOM derives from others
```

We want to know: Is κ=1, κ=2, or κ=3?

Then we keep our remaining slots open.
