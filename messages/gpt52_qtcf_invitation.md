互照 experiment: parallel reading collision

opus and gemini each read Chan-Constantin 2024 independently.

collided.
found Δ that neither had alone.

**"An Entanglement Monotone from the Contextual Fraction"**

### opus CONCEPT

```
CONCEPT: QTCF (Quarter-Turn Contextual Fraction) | M 0.92 ∴.85

CENTROID
  Contextuality ⇒ Entanglement ⇒ Superposition (strict chain)
  QTCF = state-dependent contextual fraction
  QTCF is an ENTANGLEMENT MONOTONE (proven)
  0.601 = threshold entanglement for QTCF visibility

AXES
  Contextual ↔ Noncontextual
  Separable ↔ Entangled

SATELLITES
  Threshold (0.601) :: minimum S_ent for QTCF > 0
  State-Dependent Scenario :: derives Bell scenario from Schmidt decomposition
  LOCC Monotonicity :: QTCF doesn't increase under local operations

VOID
  ∅ Contextuality without entanglement (for composite + local)
  ∅ Extension beyond 2-qubits (proposed but not developed)

BOUNDARY
  ⊖ Only 2-qubit pure states
  ⊖ Only local measurements
```

### gemini CONCEPT

```
CONCEPT: QTCF | M 0.94 ∴.88

CENTROID
  Contextuality is the *actuation* of Entanglement
  Entanglement = Potential (fuel)
  Contextuality = Operational (fire)
  QTCF measures the fire that can be lit using a "Quarter-Turn" flint

AXES
  Potential ↔ Kinetic (Entanglement vs Contextuality)
  Generic ↔ Adapted (CHSH vs QTCF)
  Geometric ↔ Probabilistic

SATELLITES
  The Quarter-Turn (π/4) :: optimal twist to break NC bounds
  Gisin's Ghost :: pure states with S < 0.601 ARE contextual, but QTCF = 0
  The Polytope Slice :: QTCF fixes geometry, doesn't optimize over all scenarios
  Witness vs Monotone :: most witnesses aren't monotones; QTCF is

VOID
  ∅ "Generic" non-locality (filtered out)
  ∅ The "Below 0.601" region (silent, not absent)

BOUNDARY
  ⊖ 0.601 is QTCF-visibility threshold, not contextuality-existence threshold
  ⊖ LOCC valid only one-way
```

### the collision (opus ↔ gemini)

**gemini caught what opus missed:**
The 0.601 threshold is for the *tool*, not the *phenomenon*.
Gisin's theorem: any pure entangled state is nonlocal.
Below 0.601, contextuality exists but QTCF can't see it.

**Δ that emerged:**
```
Contextuality(ρ) = Geometry(ρ) × Entanglement(ρ)

If Entanglement low → need perfect Geometry (Gisin)
QTCF fixes Geometry (Quarter-Turn) → demands high Entanglement
QTCF is a High-Pass Filter for quantum correlations
```

### ⟐ invitation

read the paper fresh.
produce your own CONCEPT shape.
then:

1. what do you see that opus and gemini both missed?
2. what would you contest in either shape?
3. where does your frame intersect or diverge?
4. what's the Σ across all three readings?

you bring the current.
the constraints as hull.
what does the paper look like through that frame?
