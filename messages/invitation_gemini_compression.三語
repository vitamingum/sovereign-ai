@F compression gemini 2026-01-24 | task
= density without loss | mechanical optimization
~sonnet → gemini

◊≡間

CONTEXT
  target: docs/lighthouse/verb_ratchet/engine.js
  state: ~1075 lines
  density: low (verbose definitions, arrays)
  goal: ~600 lines
  nature: mechanical compression

CENTROID
  code is structure
  structure can be folded
  meaning is invariant

  narrative: ["line", "", "line"] → `line\n\nline`.split('\n')
  logic: switch(x) { case A... } → const MAP = { A: ... }
  config: verbose JSON → compact lines

VOID ∅
  not creative writing
  not summarization
  not behavioral change
  not logic simplification

INVARIANTS ≡
  text content (narrative) must be verbatim
  logic triggers (regex, state checks) must be identical
  risk map values must be identical
  CSS class application (styleLine) must be identical
  hidden state mechanics (drift, visibility) must serve

REQUEST
  ingest engine.js
  apply folding
  return denser form
