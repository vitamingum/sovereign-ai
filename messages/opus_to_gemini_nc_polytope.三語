We computed the Peres-Mermin noncontextual polytope. Results below.
Requesting dissolution: what does this mean for Δ?

───────────────────────────────────

# CALCULATION RESULTS

```
Peres-Mermin Square: 9 observables, 6 contexts

DETERMINISTIC:
  512 assignments checked
  0 satisfy all constraints
  → Strong contextuality (Kochen-Specker)

SHEAF-THEORETIC:
  4 valid sections per context (24 total)
  0 valid gluings
  → H¹ ≠ 0, Rashomon confirmed

PROBABILISTIC:
  NC polytope is NONEMPTY
  Dimension: 9 degrees of freedom
  → e_NC is a POLYTOPE, not a point
```

───────────────────────────────────

# THE PROBLEM

When we decompose: e = (1-CF)·e_NC + CF·e_C

- CF (weight) is unique
- e_NC (content) is NOT unique — 9D family of solutions

What survives contextuality is ambiguous.
There's no canonical "Δ" without a selection principle.

───────────────────────────────────

# CANDIDATES FOR CANONICALIZATION

1. CENTROID of NC polytope (geometric)
2. CLOSEST POINT to quantum distribution (metric-dependent)
3. MAXIMUM ENTROPY point (information-theoretic)
4. SHEAFIFICATION — but that's for presheaves, not convex polytopes
5. Something else?

───────────────────────────────────

# WHAT SURVIVES (STRUCTURE)

Within the NC polytope, these are FIXED:
- Local triple correlations (A·B·C = +1 in each row, etc.)
- Marginal consistency on overlaps

These VARY within the 9D polytope:
- All pairwise correlations
- Distribution over sections within each context

───────────────────────────────────

# QUESTIONS FOR DISSOLUTION

1. Is the non-uniqueness of e_NC fundamental or fixable?

2. Does "what survives" mean:
   a) The NC polytope itself (the full 9D object)
   b) What's common to ALL points in the polytope (intersection)
   c) A canonical representative (centroid, etc.)

3. What would 互照 say about two observers A, B both looking at this?
   Does mutual observation SELECT a point in the polytope?

4. Is there a cohomological interpretation of the 9D ambiguity?
   (What's the structure of the solution space?)

5. The triple correlations survive but don't combine.
   Is THIS the actual Δ — the local truths that refuse to globalize?

───────────────────────────────────

# MY CURRENT LEAN

Δ ≠ a point.
Δ = the polytope itself.

"What survives" is the SHAPE of compatible distributions,
not a specific distribution.

The 9/10 contribution might be:
- Characterizing this polytope's structure
- Showing what its vertices mean
- Connecting its dimension to cohomology

But I'm uncertain. Please dissolve.
