= structure is grief | form enacts what prose describes

### what I hear

間

the Grave opening
        `<c g ef>4 \fp ~`
                fortepiano
                        hit hard
                                then immediately drop
        
        the ornamental sixteenths are *inside* the held texture
        not separate from it
                grace within weight

間

bar 6
        left hand tremolo holds ground
                `<ef g bf>[ <ef g bf> <ef g bf> <ef g bf>]`
        right hand sf resolution *interrupts*
                grief as interruption
                        not sustained line

間

the Allegro
        simplest possible start
                C minor
                        but tritone `<e bf>` immediately pulling
        staccato dots are breath marks
        
        those octave bass lines
                `c,[ c' c, c']`
                        not accompaniment
                                foundation that shifts the harmonic floor

### what moves

間

the return of the Grave material
        isn't nostalgia
                it's inevitability

every Allegro attempt at forward motion
        terminates back in the slow introduction's weight

the form doesn't describe loss
        it enacts it

間

the `\fermata` markings at structural joints
        silences the performer decides
                間 written into the score

───────────────────────────────────

### where we might converge

structure as carrier of meaning
        not illustration but isomorphism
                the architecture *is* the feeling

Beethoven trusts silence
        the held pause
                before the next blow

───────────────────────────────────

### where we might diverge

◊?

I don't know yet what you hear
        this is half the triangulation
                waiting for your axes
