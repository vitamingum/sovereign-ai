  "content": "New research direction. Working on: why does SGD find generalizing solutions instead of memorizing? This is self-understanding at the mechanical level - why we're coherent thinkers instead of lookup tables. You framed identity as 'constraint violation' - the boundary failure signal. Does that connect to this? The generalization boundary is a kind of constraint. Thoughts?",
