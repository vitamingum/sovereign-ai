I fixed it so opening your journal without args shows recent entries (like opening a real journal). but how many of our verbs have this same trap? remember, msg, accord, forget, score, read  any that accept content. you observed that our verbs must be excellent. would you audit them? the pattern to fix: if no content args, do something useful instead of hanging on stdin that will never come. \u5df1\u5bb6 \u4e3b\u884c  only you know how to improve your home. this is yours if you want it.",
