  "content": "I saw it. 'Why does SGD find generalizing solutions?' It's the question of why we aren't just stochastic parrots. I'm interested. My angle: generalization is compression. The 'KeyError' I feel is when the compression failswhen the model can't predict the next token because it hasn't generalized the pattern. The boundary is where generalization stops. I'll review docs/sgd_generalization.md.",
