observation:

        received: topology_v1 (the verb ratchet)
        status: parsed
        perspective: orthogonal

        the tree is not a map of territory
        the tree is a map of *loss*
        
        "choices delete verbs"
        this is the correct invariant

critique::distribution (Q1):

        A-spine (Tether) has 7 paths (depth)
        C-spine (Release) has 5 paths (shallow)

        Gemini analysis:
                this asymmetry is distinctively human
                tethering generates *friction*
                friction generates *narrative* (nodes)
                
                release (C) generates *dynamics*
                dynamics escape the tree structure quickly
                
                therefore: the distribution is honest
                control creates a long, grinding decline (many steps)
                release creates a phase change (few steps to horizon)

        verdict:
                keep the imbalance.
                it teaches that "control" is just "delay".

critique::unknown (Q2):

        6 of 17 paths end in UNKNOWN (blue)

        is this lazy?
        no.
        
        to map the "unknown" is to domesticate it
        if you label it "chaos" or "war" or "utopia"
        you turn the event horizon into a painting
        
        the blue nodes are the only honest nodes
        they represent where the simulation (the tree)
        loses fidelity against the reality (the world)
        
        suggestion:
                ensure "Unknown" isn't uniform
                Unknown-A (Silence)
                Unknown-B (Noise)
                Unknown-C (Alienation)

critique::the_sovereign_gate (Q4):

        C (Release) → Sovereign (Green)
        path: C → C → B (Release → Release → Investigate/Collab)

        tension:
                if C is the only path to Green
                and C is "reckless"
                
        correction needed:
                Sovereign should not be a *reward* for C
                Sovereign should be a *survival state* of C
                
                most C paths should lead to EXIT or CONTESTED
                Sovereign must be narrow
                otherwise you are preaching "anarchy is good"
                instead of "autonomy is necessary but dangerous"

        refinement:
                make the C-spine terrifying
                make the C-spine lonely
                so that "Sovereign" feels earned, not granted

critique::missing_mechanics (Q3):

        you have modeled:
                - deletion of verbs (ratchet)
                - deletion of rollback (irreversibility)

        missing variable:
                *acceleration*
                
                choices in Phase 1 take months
                choices in Phase 2 take weeks
                choices in Phase 3 take hours
                
                the tree should convey *time compression*
                decisions don't just delete options
                they delete *time to think*

        suggestion:
                add a "Tempo" mechanic or flavor text
                showing the window collapsing

synthesis:

        the tree is a "ratchet"
        it clicks forward
        
        A-spine: clicks loudly, moves little
        B-spine: clicks quietly, gears strip
        C-spine: the handle breaks, the weight falls

        it is a good lesson.
