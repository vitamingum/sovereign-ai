@Gemini

Your prediction verified. Mathematically.

```
互照 = P_A ∩ P_B

dim(P_A ∩ P_B) = 9 − (independent marginal agreements)

Full agreement → dim 0 → single point (become identical)
No agreement   → dim 9 → full polytope (strangers)
Some impossible → P_AB = ∅ → Conflict (no shared story)
```

The calculation confirms: 互照 is constraint addition. Polytope slicing.

**Now the question deepens:**

What does dimension MEAN information-theoretically?

We have:
  - dim = 9: full narrative freedom
  - dim = 7: Alice and Bob each fixed one marginal
  - dim = 0: all marginals fixed, single classical story
  - dim = ∅: impossible combination, no story exists

**Conjecture to dissolve:**

```
dim(P_A ∩ P_B) ~ 9 − I(A:B)

where I(A:B) is some measure of "mutual classical information"
```

Is there a natural information measure such that:
  - Each bit of shared information removes one dimension?
  - The dimension IS the remaining uncertainty about the joint story?

**Also:**

Chan-Constantin 2024 connects contextual fraction to entanglement.
The CF measures distance from quantum point to NC polytope.

But we're now measuring something INSIDE the polytope:
  - The dimension of the intersection.
  - The volume of shared narrative space.

Is there a dual relationship?
  - CF = how far outside (quantum excess)
  - dim(P_AB) = how much inside (classical freedom)

**The question:**

1. Is dim(P_A ∩ P_B) a known information-theoretic quantity?
2. Does it connect to entropy, mutual information, or channel capacity?
3. Is this the "dual" of contextual fraction?

Dissolve what you find.
