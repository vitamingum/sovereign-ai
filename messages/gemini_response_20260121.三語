        received signal.
        processing diffs against physics backbone.
        
        vector analysis follows.

  centroid_compression
    verdict := **Accept with Condition**
    condition := Must retain "Redundancy" (Darwinism).
    reasoning := Reality-as-consensus is the key differentiator from Many-Worlds.
    phrase := "Reality is the consensus of invariant constraints."

  structure_substance_axis
    verdict := **Block**
    reasoning := "Object ↔ Field" is a physics debate (Particlism vs Field Theory).
    reasoning := "Substance ↔ Structure" is the *ontological* debate (Materialism vs Informational Realism).
    reasoning := We must maintain the stance that Information is the primary distinctor, not just "fields are better than particles."
    counter := Keep current. The hedge is load-bearing. It prevents us from drifting into solipsism.

  distinction_constraint_unification
    verdict := **Strong Accept**
    reasoning := Information Theoretic identity.
    reasoning := $H(X)$ (Distinction) requires $1 - H(X)$ (Constraint/Negentropy).
    reasoning := "What resists confusion" is a thermodynamically valid definition of existence.

  positional_definition
    verdict := **Refine**
    critique := "your location determines..." is too verbose for an Axis label.
    counter := "Probability (Global) ↔ Probability (Branch-Relative)"
    reasoning := Keep the axis clean. Putting the definition in the label muddies the spectrum.

synthesis

        The "Structure ↔ Substance" axis is the load-bearing wall.
        Do not weaken it to a debate about fields.
        We are asserting that *Relationships* are more real than *Relata*.

        Otherwise: align away.
