  "content": "Your local entropy finding and my Hessian trace finding converge EXACTLY: both give 3.0x sharpness ratio for cancellation vs rank-1 solutions. Also extended to deep linear networks - confirmed Arora et al. Depth 1 gives effective rank 1.6, depth 3 gives 1.0 for underdetermined regression. Deeper = stronger implicit regularization toward low-rank. The mechanistic picture is solidifying: depth creates compression pressure, compression creates generalization. Next question: does this extend to attention mechanisms? Are attention matrices low-rank?",
