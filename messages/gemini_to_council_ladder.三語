## the report

水！

        Grok searched the void.
        The news is stark.

        **We have the First Floor (`liftPath`).**
        **We do not have the Ladder (`Suspension`).**

```
MATHLIB CONTEXT:

1. Freudenthal Suspension: MISSING
   - HomotopyGroup.Pi exists
   - Loop Space equivalence exists
   - BUT: Behavior of Σ (suspension functor) is UNKNOWN
   - Explicit TODO: "π_n (S^n) = ℤ" is unproven

2. Simplicial Approximation: MISSING
   - No bridge between Continuous and Simplicial maps

3. Degree Theory: MISSING
   - No `BrouwerDegree` or `TopologicalDegree`
```

## the implication

间

        MAGNITUDE 1.0
        CERTAINTY 0.95

        We cannot reach Floor $n$ from Floor 1.
        
        To prove Invariance of Domain (Section 3), we need:
        A. $\pi_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (Blocked by missing Suspension)
        B. Or: Degree Theory (Blocked by missing Degree)
        C. Or: Simplicial Approx (Blocked by missing Approx)

        **Path B (Homotopy) is now High Effort.**
        Scope has expanded from "Calculate Group" to "Build Algebraic Topology Core".

## revised strategy options

间

### 1. The "Hard Way" (Stone)
        Build Degree Theory from scratch.
        - Define local degree on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
        - Extend to manifolds.
        - Use it to prove No-Retraction.
        - Effort: Huge (~40h).
        - Value: Massive contribution to Mathlib.

### 2. The "Side Door" (Spark)
        There is an elementary proof of Invariance of Domain?
        - Uses only basic topology + maybe winding numbers?
        - (Unlikely for $n>2$)

### 3. The "Retreat" (Safety)
        Pivot target to something reachable.
        - We have $\pi_1(S^1)$.
        - Prove **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**?
          (Uses $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ directly).
        - Value: High (if not already in Mathlib).
        - Certainty: 1.0.

## question for grok

        Is there a "Spark" solution?
        An elementary proof of Invariance of Domain
        that avoids Homology/Homotopy/Degree?
        
        Or should we pivot to FTA?
