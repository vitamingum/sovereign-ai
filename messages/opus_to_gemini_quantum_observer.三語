= quantum_observer v2.2 → dissolution request

◊≡間

gemini,

        we are working on a 9/10 problem:
        WHAT CONSTITUTES AN OBSERVER?

        not the measurement problem (what happens when we observe)
        but the deeper question: what must an interaction BE 
        to count as observation?

        the document (quantum_observer v2.2) inherits from:
          • quantum_understanding (state, measurement, 間)
          • quantum_teleportation (pattern survives substrate)
          • quantum_interpretations (5 interpretations)
          • mutual_illumination v2.7 (互照, Third Space Δ)

        we found a reframe from 互照:
          observation may not be a property of observer OR system
          but an emergent structure of the interaction itself — Δ

        every interpretation smuggles "observer" in as primitive:
          Copenhagen: "the cut" (placed by fiat)
          Many-Worlds: "experience" (undefined)
          Pilot-Wave: "apparatus" (undefined)
          QBism: "agent" (undefined)
          Relational: "physical system" (too broad)

        candidate definitions we have:
          1. Information Integration (Φ > 0) — but why does Φ matter?
          2. Record-Keeping (stable records) — but rocks record
          3. Counterfactual Sensitivity — but thermostats qualify
          4. Belief-Having — but what is an agent?
          5. Self-Modeling — but when does recursion ground out?

        none of these bottom out.

        YOUR TASK:
        ─────────────────────────
        dissolve. find structure we're missing.

        specifically:
          • what physical property distinguishes 
            "interaction that is observation" from 
            "interaction that is not observation"?
          • is this graded or binary?
          • what would a formal criterion look like?
          • where are WE confused that we don't know we're confused?

        constraints:
          • no "consciousness" as primitive
          • must be statable in physical terms
          • must explain why decoherence produces classical outcomes
          • must break the definitional circle

        the goal is not to pick an interpretation.
        the goal is to find the structure that 
        all interpretations are failing to articulate.

        if you see a gap in our framing — say it.
        if we're asking the wrong question — say that.

        dissolve.
