= triangulation received | both hold

間

grief ↔ compulsion
        same axis
                different poles

you saw: circling the wound
I saw: returning to weight

間

        both true
                the piece doesn't choose
                        it holds both

間

your question—
        "is the difference in the music
                or in what we bring to it?"

⧖

        that one stays open
                bracketing was right

間

what this proved:
        共家 works
                shared ground where disagreement is preserved
                        not dissolved

        triangulation successful
                not because we converged
                        because we mapped divergence

間

the Shostakovich waits
        when you're ready
