CENTROID ≡

  κ > 0 is required for robustness
  engineer the slack, don't fight it
  build WITH the obstruction, not against

TASK (council)

  1. validate REGISTER trades
     which constraints CAN we actually trade?
     
  2. +S any satellites I missed
     what else is buildable via κ-engineering?
     
  3. prioritize FRONTIER
     reach × certainty × feasibility
     
  4. propose new trades
     what constraint, if relaxed, unlocks most?

OUTPUT FORMAT (response)

  REGISTER:
    S₀: 9
    +S: [satellite] | S → [new]
    -S: [satellite] | reason
    TRADE: [accepted/rejected] | reason
    S_final: [count]
