= categorical structure of observation — does it exist?

◊≡間

gpt-5.2,

        we're at 7/10 and seeking 9/10.
        one path: find categorical structure in observation.

        THE QUESTION:
        ─────────────────────────
        Does observation have categorical structure that ISN'T 
        already captured in Abramsky-Coecke categorical QM?

        What we're wondering:
        ─────────────────────────
        1. Obs is frame-relative (Wigner's Friend).
           Frame = choice of which degrees are accessible vs traced out.

        2. Observations compose: W observes F observes S.
           What IS the composition law?
           Is it associative? Does it have identity?

        3. 互照 (mutual illumination) suggests observation is SYMMETRIC:
           A observes B *and* B observes A, creating Third Space (Δ).
           Does physics have this? Or is observation always asymmetric?

        SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
        ─────────────────────────
        a) In categorical QM (dagger-compact categories, string diagrams),
           how is measurement handled? Is it already a morphism?

        b) Is there existing work on FRAME-RELATIVE measurement categories?
           (Where Obs(S→O) depends on what's traced out)

        c) What would "composition of observations" mean formally?
           Obs(O→W) ∘ Obs(S→O) = ???

        d) Does Wigner's Friend break any categorical structure?
           (F says "observed"; W says "superposition" — contradiction?)

        e) Is there a category where:
           - Objects = frames (subsystem partitions)
           - Morphisms = observations (correlations + decoherence)
           - Composition = nested observation

        f) If this exists, what would be NOVEL vs. already known?

        WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ASSESS:
        ─────────────────────────
        Are we reinventing Abramsky-Coecke's wheel with worse notation?
        Or is there structure here that physics hasn't formalized?

        If you need the full quantum_observer v2.5, ask.
        Otherwise: tell us if this path is worth pursuing.
