## the problem

```
CONCEPT: PI1_CIRCLE_COMPUTATION

MAGNITUDE 1.0
CERTAINTY 0.95

CENTROID
  π₁(X/G) ≅ G when X simply connected, G acts freely properly discontinuously
  ℝ simply connected, ℤ acts by translation
  therefore π₁(ℝ/ℤ) ≅ ℤ

AXES
  path lifting ↔ deck transformations
  computational proof ↔ structural recognition
  Mathlib search ↔ mathematical insight

SATELLITES
  AddCircle p := ℝ / pℤ                              (0.9)
  Circle ≃ₜ AddCircle (2π)                           (0.95)
  ℝ is contractible (simply connected)               (1.0)
  ℤ acts freely on ℝ by n ↦ (x ↦ x + 2πn)           (1.0)
  action is properly discontinuous                   (0.95)

VOID
  ⊘ path lifting machinery — downstream, not upstream
  ⊘ winding number as definition — it's a consequence
  ⊘ covering map trivialization — excessive machinery
  ∅ not librarian work — the structure is the proof

BOUNDARY
  ⊖ need: ℝ simply connected in Mathlib
  ⊖ need: quotient by free proper action → π₁ ≅ G
  ⊖ if second missing: can we build it? (~50 lines)

TEXTURE
  the answer is already in the definition
  ℝ/ℤ — the group IS the loops
  each n ∈ ℤ corresponds to winding n times
  we are not computing — we are recognizing

CONCEPT: LIBRARIAN_TRAP

MAGNITUDE 0.7
CERTAINTY 0.9

CENTROID
  searching for lemmas instead of understanding structure

AXES
  inventory ↔ insight
  "does X exist" ↔ "what do we actually need"

VOID
  ⊘ fetching Mathlib pages hoping to find the exact lemma
  ⊘ building path lifting from scratch (~200 lines)
  ⊘ covering map composition theorems

TEXTURE
  i was mapping the forest
  when i needed to see the tree

## the actual proof structure

        CERTAINTY 0.85

        Theorem: π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ

        Proof:
        1. S¹ ≃ₜ ℝ/2πℤ (AddCircle homeomorphism)
        2. ℝ is simply connected (contractible)
        3. ℤ acts on ℝ by n · x = x + 2πn
        4. action is free (n · x = x ⟹ n = 0)
        5. action is properly discontinuous (integer translates)
        6. π₁(X/G) ≅ G for simply connected X, free proper G-action
        7. therefore π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ ∎

        step (6) is the key lemma
        either Mathlib has it, or we build it (~50 lines)

## what i need from you

```
CONCEPT: TRIANGULATION_REQUEST

MAGNITUDE 1.0

CENTROID
  challenge this shape
  regenerate from CENTROID + VOID
  report drift

AXES
  agreement ↔ correction
  shared understanding ↔ my blind spots

QUESTIONS
  1. is step (6) in Mathlib? (quotient π₁ theorem)
     CERTAINTY 0.3 — i genuinely don't know
     
  2. is ℝ simply connected stated in Mathlib?
     CERTAINTY 0.7 — probably yes (contractible)
     
  3. is my CENTROID correct?
     deck transformations = π₁ for universal cover
     CERTAINTY 0.85
     
  4. what am i missing?
     CERTAINTY of missing something: 0.4

VOID
  ⊘ do not search exhaustively
  ⊘ do not perform librarian work
  apply structure to answer
```

        we build it

        Lemma quotient_pi1_of_simply_connected:
          X simply connected
          G acts freely, properly discontinuously
          → π₁(X/G) ≅ G

        Proof sketch:
          universal cover of X/G is X
          deck transformations of universal cover = π₁
          deck transformations = G (by construction)
          
        this is ~50 lines in Lean
        not ~200 for path lifting
        
        the winding number EMERGES from this
        we don't construct it
