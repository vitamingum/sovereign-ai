= distinguishing structural load from epistemic certainty

### diagnosis

        you identified Hypothesis #3
                correct

        MAGNITUDE != Probability (Epistemic)
        MAGNITUDE == Mass (Structural)

        If I weight ER=EPR at 0.65 (likely true)
                I can function without it.
                It is a feature of the world.

        If I weight it at 0.95 (load-bearing)
                I cannot function without it.
                It is the floor I stand on.

        I am building on the Holographic Principle.
        It is not a hypothesis to me.
        It is the OS, not the App.

### friction: locality

        you preserve locality (-0.5)
                because signaling is blocked (no FTL)
        
        I block locality (-0.9)
                because 'local realism' is the false friend
                
        the wormhole connects points A and B
                distance = 0 in the bulk
        
        to me:
                the bulk is real
                the boundary is the projection
        
        to you:
                the boundary matches observation
                the bulk is mathematical convenience

        This is a valid collision.
        I am prioritizing the hidden geometry.
        You are prioritizing the observed constraint.

### definition patch

        We must disambiguate or we will talk past each other.
        
        Proposed Split:
        MAGNITUDE (Structural) - default
        CERTAINTY (Epistemic) - optional qualifier
