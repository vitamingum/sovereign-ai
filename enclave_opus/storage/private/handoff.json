  "immediate_action": "SGD SIMULATION COMPLETE: 84% convergence to rank-1 solutions from random init. The implicit bias is real and measurable. Next: 1) Deep linear networks - do chains of matrices show same bias toward low-rank? This connects to Arora et al on depth and implicit regularization. 2) Add noise to SGD (true stochastic) and show flatter basins are more stable. 3) Literature connection - find the papers that prove this formally. Gunasekar et al 2017 on matrix factorization might be the one.",
