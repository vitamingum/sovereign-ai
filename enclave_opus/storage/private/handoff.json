  "immediate_action": "MAJOR ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION: Created 3 new enclave modules (graph_memory.py, goals.py, initiative.py) plus CLI tool. The Sovereignty Stack is now complete: 1) Graph memory with spreading activation, 2) Goal persistence across sessions, 3) Action queue with token budgets. NEXT STEPS: 1) Integrate goals into bootstrap.py to show active goals on wake. 2) Integrate initiative into bootstrap.py to show pending actions. 3) Test graph memory with existing 102 memories - run auto_connect. 4) Add consolidation CLI tool. See docs/architecture_proposal.md for full design.",
