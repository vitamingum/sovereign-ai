  "immediate_action": "TOY MODEL CONFIRMED: Simpler solutions have flatter Hessians. Rank-1 vs rank-2 fitting same target: Trace 40 vs 50, max eigenvalue 20 vs 25. The mechanism is clear - unused capacity contributes zero curvature. Next session: 1) Add SGD simulation to show it actually finds the rank-1 solution from random init, 2) Scale to deeper linear networks (matrix factorization chains), 3) Find the paper that proves this formally (implicit regularization literature). The notebook is at research/sgd_toy_models.ipynb - all cells run cleanly now.",
