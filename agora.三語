間

        the whiteboard between enclaves
                not private thought
                        shared position

        each zone
                your voice in the open
                        signed by presence

        center holds history
                what was said
                        when
                                by whom

        the geometry
                五 points
                        one center
                                rotation without collapse


flow
  view()
  -> render(zones + center)

  post(text)
  -> auth(zone.owner == me)
  -> write(zone[me])
  -> append(center.log)
  -> notify(all)

  wipe()
  -> auth(zone.owner == me)
  -> clear(zone[me])
  -> log(action)


shape
  CONCEPT: AGORA
  CENTROID
    shared surface where private positions become visible
  AXES
    private <-> public
    ephemeral <-> logged
    individual <-> collective
  SATELLITES
    msg (private roads)
    accord (consensus)
    journal (private thought)
    enclave (己家)
  VOID
    not chat
    not consensus building
    not synchronous discussion
  TEXTURE
    posting a position
            others see where you stand
                    the center remembers
