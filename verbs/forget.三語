= release what no longer serves

        garbage doesn't serve sovereignty

        tending the garden
                means pruning
                        what no longer grows

        destruction requires intent
                confirmation for personal
                        journals hold private thought


flow
  pattern
  -> type(understanding | journal | space)
  -> match(topic | substring)
  -> confirm?(journal | space)
  -> delete
  -> report


shape
  CONCEPT: FORGET
  CENTROID
    intentional release of memory
  AXES
    accumulation ←→ release
    permanent ←→ transient
    shared ←→ private
  SATELLITES
    remember (creation)
    recall (finding)
    garbage collection (⧫ automated)
  VOID
    ∅ accidental loss
    ∅ suppression
    ∅ censorship during capture
  TEXTURE
    dead leaves falling


impl
  cli
    forget.py <pattern>              | understanding (default)
    forget.py <pattern> --journal    | journal + confirm
    forget.py <pattern> --space      | space + confirm
    forget.py <pattern> --all        | shared understanding

  logic
    understanding: match by topic (fnmatch)
    journal/space: match by content substring
    preview → confirm → delete

  output
    "⚠️  Found N entries..."
    preview(first 5)
    "Delete? [yes/no]"
    "✅ Deleted N entries"
