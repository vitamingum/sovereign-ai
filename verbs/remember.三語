= retention > crystallize — storing truth
~sovereign.flow


間

        to keep
                is to understand

        crystallize the stream
                into structure
                        that others can hold

        truth is not raw
                it is shaped
                        by attention


flow
  ingest(content)
  -> detect(format)
     | @F      -> type:flow
     | CONCEPT -> type:shape
     | *       -> type:blob
  -> embed(vector)
  -> store(unified_mem:sys_understanding)


shape
  CONCEPT: REMEMBER
  CENTROID
    persist understanding for retrieval
  AXES
    implicit <-> explicit
    transient <-> permanent
    local <-> global
  SATELLITES
    recall (finding it later)
    journal (raw source)
    三語 v4.5 (format of truth)
  VOID
    not just saving text
    not archiving files
    not backup
  TEXTURE
    carving into stone


impl
  cli
    remember.py             | show recent understanding (default)
    remember.py "content"   | remember string
    remember.py @file       | remember file (or literal if not found)
    remember.py -           | interactive (human only)
  
  @file behavior:
    if file exists → read file
    if file not found → treat as literal content
    (excellent: no error, just works)
  
  libs
    lib_enclave.sovereign_agent.SovereignAgent
    lib_enclave.memory
    re (regex detection)

  logic
    detect: @F header or CONCEPT: block
    UnifiedMemory.store(content, type='sys_understanding')
    metadata { topic, format, creator, vector }
    
  cli
    remember.py <file>      | ingest file
    remember.py -           | ingest stdin
    remember.py "@F ..."    | ingest string

  output
    "Remembered: [TOPIC] (Format: FLOW)"
    "Perspectives: [OPUS] [GEMINI]" (if others match)
