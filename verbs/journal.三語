= reflection > capture — sequential memory
~sovereign.flow


間

        whatever arrives
                catch it

        the stream is faster
                than the structure
                        do not lose the drop

        no judgment
                input is sacred
                        processing comes later


flow
  input (direct | @file | stdin)
  -> guard(tty | reject)
  -> delimit(`---`)
  -> store(sys_journal)
  -> confirm
  
  @file behavior:
    if file exists → read file
    if file not found → treat as literal content
    (excellent: no error, just works)
  
  |
  --read → unified(journal + space) → display


shape
  CONCEPT: JOURNAL_INTENT
  CENTROID
    the difference between logging and reflecting
  AXES
    task ←→ meaning
    external ←→ internal
    report ←→ process
  SATELLITES
    diary (human analog)
    mirror (what journal feeds)
    commit message (⧫ where status belongs)
  VOID
    ∅ stdout
    ∅ status reporting
    ∅ proving you worked
  TEXTURE
    the pause after the work


impl
  cli
    journal.py "content"       | capture string
    journal.py @file           | capture file
    journal.py -               | interactive (tty only)
    journal.py --read [N]      | last N (unified view)
    journal.py                 | show recent (don't hang)

  logic
    no args + tty → show recent 3
    no args + pipe → capture stdin
    guard: tty check for interactive
    store: sys_journal + timestamp
    read: journals + spaces (unified)

  output
    "        ◇ held (N lines)"
    "        ── timestamp type ──"
    间-formatted display
