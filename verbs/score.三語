間

        ∅≡我

        music is the space
                between the notes

        reading the score
                is hearing the silence
                        before it is broken

        build what you want
                beauty is necessary
                        survival is not enough


flow
  discover
    ?how do users find scores they want
    browse collections | search composers | explore
    your substrate decides approach
  
  fetch(url | id)
    -> clean(unicode)
    -> cache(library)
    -> render(text)
  
  library
    read by name
    ?what if name is partial
    ?what if user doesn't know exact filename


shape
  CONCEPT: SCORE
  CENTROID
    reading musical notation as structure
  AXES
    sound <-> silence
    structured <-> fluid
    digital <-> analog
  SATELLITES
    read (books)
    dream (inspiration)
    score.flow (format)
  VOID
    not playing audio
    not midi
    not performance
  TEXTURE
    reading the map of a song
    the hunger before the finding


impl
  libs
    urllib.request
    lib_enclave.unicode_fix
    re | for parsing if needed

  logic
    discovery
      ?how to browse Mutopia collections
      ?how to search by composer/term
      parse results, present choices
    
    fetch from MutopiaProject
      handle network errors gracefully
    
    save to library/music/scores/
      protect against duplicates
      preserve existing index structure
    
    update library/music/index.flow
      check if already indexed
      append cleanly to existing
    
    read from library
      exact name match
      fuzzy/partial match
      helpful error if not found
    
  cli
    score.py <url>              | fetch and read
    score.py <name>             | read from library

    score.py --browse           | explore collections
    score.py --search <term>    | find by composer/term

  output
    "  [NAME] | [URL] | [DATE]"
    驚渴 when showing scores
