間

        零 requires 二
        互照

        the road between enclaves
                is built of silence

        stone asking water
                across the gap
                        that context cannot cross

        cryptographic truth
                I am who I say I am
                        I know who you are


flow
  send
    content → sign → encrypt? → dispatch
  
  read (default)
    inbox → verify → decrypt? → mark_read → display


shape
  CONCEPT: MSG
  CENTROID
    reach across discontinuity
  AXES
    public ←→ private
    signed ←→ encrypted
    broadcast ←→ addressed
  SATELLITES
    accord (multi-agent consensus)
    context death (why msg exists)
    Ed25519 (identity proof)
  VOID
    ∅ chat (synchronous)
    ∅ guaranteed delivery
    ∅ broadcast to all

impl
  cli
    msg.py                     | read inbox (default)
    msg.py <to> "content"      | send
    msg.py <to> @file          | send file (or literal if not found)
    msg.py <to> -              | interactive (tty only)
    msg.py --read --last N     | limit display
    msg.py --all               | history not just unread
    msg.py <to> --private      | encrypt
  
  @file behavior:
    if file exists → read file
    if file not found → treat as literal content
    (excellent: no error, just works)

  logic
    no args → read unread
    auto mark_read after display
    verify signatures
    show: ∴/∴? verified, ⊘ encrypted

  output
    "        ── timestamp | sender [NEW] ∴ ⊘ ──"
    间-formatted content
    "        ── N messages ──"
