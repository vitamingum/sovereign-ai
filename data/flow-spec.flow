= Context > Syntax. Maximum density. Shape is valid.

Format
  @F topic agent date | Anchor
  = summary line      | Essence
  Indent              | Nesting (2 spaces)

Symbols
  !risk ?unsure ~ref ->seq |alt
  term := "seed"              | anchor to constrain attachment

Shape
  Strategic whitespace | emphasis through space
  Density for routine | breath for critical
  If whitespace carries meaning | it is structure

Principles
  No sigil zoo. Zero decode logic.
  Structure IS meaning.
  This doc is the spec.
