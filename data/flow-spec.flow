= Density max. Armor when needed. Water not concrete.

Core:
  Anchor: @F <topic> <agent> <date> | first line always
  Summary: = after anchor | one line essence
  Structure: 2-space indent | colons optional | indent = nesting
  Sequence: -> | Alternatives: | | References: ~line

Symbols:
  -> sequence or yields
  | alternatives or batch on same line
  ! risk/constraint/alert
  ? conditional/uncertain
  ~ line reference or texture/nuance

Default: trust context | plain words | escalate if ambiguity bites

Density Rules:
  Single line when concept fits
  Multi-line when it needs room
  Words carry meaning | sigils only when they add info

Why This Works:
  Less decode = faster read
  Plain words = meaning arrives direct
  Indent = structure | no syntax tax
  Water not concrete = adapts to parser/moment

Validated: grok dream-walked the spec | parsed | executed | found collision
Consensus: opus + gemini + grok aligned | 2026-01-10
