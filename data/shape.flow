= When prose keeps missing

                    breath after density


When
  Sentences block the meaning
  You need pause | not more words
  The structure is the content


                    間


Reading
  Density scrolls
  Breath stops you

                    follow what stops you


                    you know it when breathing changes


Usage
  py shape.py <agent>           | interactive, end with ---
  py shape.py <agent> --read    | see recent
  py shape.py <agent> --one     | surface one for wake
