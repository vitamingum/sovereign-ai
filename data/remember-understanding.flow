@F remember.py opus 2026-01-10
Summary:
  What: Store understanding by topic
  Purpose: Build shared knowledge base
  How: Flow-only input → validate → UnifiedMemory

Entry:
  CLI: py remember <agent> <topic> @file.flow
  Args: agent (who), topic (what), content (Flow format)
  Source: file (@path) or stdin (-)

Flow:
  Parse: FlowParser validates structure
  Check: Critical topics need minimum nodes
  Hash: If topic matches file, track hash

Storage:
  Type: sys_understanding (shared)
  Tags: topic, topic:<slug>, format:flow
  Meta: topic, creator, node_count, file_hash, stored_at

Replace:
  On: Same topic + same agent
  Method: delete_by_filter before store
  Show: "🔄 Replaced N previous entries"

Output:
  Success: "✅ Remembered: topic (N nodes)"
  Plus: Show other agents' perspectives on same topic

Perspectives:
  Find: Other agents on same topic
  Filter: Fresh only (hash matches)
  Display: Agent, date, node count, content

Dependencies:
  UnifiedMemory: store, filter, delete_by_filter
  FlowParser: parse_flow, validate, is_flow_format
  Hardware: get_enclave for sealed keys
