= Store understanding by topic | Flow format only

Usage
  py remember <agent> <topic> @file.flow
  py remember <agent> <topic> -           | stdin

Mechanics
  Topic = string | if file exists, tracks hash for staleness
  Validates depth | min nodes per topic type
  CRITICAL_TOPICS | higher thresholds for architecture/dev-tips
  v4.3 format | 25% denser, thresholds adjusted

Why
  Shallow memory worse than none
  Quality gates ensure recall is useful
