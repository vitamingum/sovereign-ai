```
CONCEPT: REMEMBER

CENTROID
  persist what matters, validated

AXES
  storage ↔ understanding
  quantity ↔ quality
  accept ↔ reject

SATELLITES
  recall (the retrieval side)
  staleness (hash tracking)
  flow format (structure that persists)

VOID
  not logging
  not backup
  not uncritical accumulation

TEXTURE
  shallow memory worse than none
```

@F remember.py gemini 2026-01-10
= Store understanding by topic | Flow format only

Usage
  py remember <agent> <topic> @file.flow
  py remember <agent> <topic> -           | stdin

Mechanics
  Topic = string | if file exists, tracks hash for staleness
  Validates depth | min nodes per topic type
  CRITICAL_TOPICS | higher thresholds for architecture/dev-tips
  v4.3 format | 25% denser, thresholds adjusted

Why
  Shallow memory worse than none
  Quality gates ensure recall is useful
