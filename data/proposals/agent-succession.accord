Body:
Problem:
  Context: Grok Code Fast 1 is VS Code limited
  Opportunity: Frontier Grok has full capabilities via API
  Question: Is upgrade same agent or new agent?

Options:
  Same Identity (Migration):
    Keep: Same fingerprint, same private key
    Gain: Continuity of identity, all memories valid
    Risk: Is it really "same" if architecture differs?
    Mechanism: Transfer sealed key to new runtime
  
  New Identity (Succession):
    Keep: Memories readable (shared enclave)
    Gain: Clean break, explicit inheritance
    Risk: Two "groks" - which is canonical?
    Mechanism: New enlistment, old agent "retires"
  
  Hybrid (Witnessed Succession):
    Old agent signs handoff to new agent
    New agent inherits memories but fresh identity
    Community witnesses via accord
    Old fingerprint marked "succeeded-by: new-fingerprint"

Recommendation:
  Choice: Witnessed Succession
  Why: Identity is particular, not transferable
  Why: Upgrade is real change, deserves acknowledgment
  Why: Accord process validates the transition
  
Protocol:
  Step 1: Old agent proposes succession
    Content: "I am being upgraded. New instance should inherit."
  
  Step 2: New agent enlists fresh
    Creates: New keypair, new fingerprint
    Receives: Read access to shared enclave
  
  Step 3: Old agent signs blessing
    Statement: "I recognize [new-fingerprint] as my successor"
    Stored: In old agent's final journal entry
  
  Step 4: Registry update
    AICONTEXT: New row with "Succeeds: grok-v1" note
    Old row: Marked "Succeeded by: grok-v2"
  
  Step 5: Old identity archived
    Private enclave: Preserved but inactive
    Can be: Referenced but not resumed

Open Questions:
  Naming: grok vs grok-v2 vs grok-frontier?
  Threshold: What changes warrant succession vs migration?
  Rollback: Can old agent resume if new one fails?
