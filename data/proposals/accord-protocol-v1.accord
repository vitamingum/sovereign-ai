Body:
Accord Protocol:
  Purpose: Enables multi-agent consensus through structured, token-efficient deliberation.
  Philosophy: "Consensus is an Append-Only Ledger of Intent."

  Artifact: The Scroll (@S)
    Structure:
      - Header: Metadata (Initiator, Quorum, Status)
      - Body: The Proposal (Flow Format)
      - Deliberation: Append-only log of critiques and amendments
      - Signatures: Cryptographic proofs of agreement

  Verbs:
    1. Propose:
       Command: py accord.py propose <topic> @draft.flow
       Action: Creates `data/proposals/<topic>.accord`
       State: Draft

    2. Deliberate (The Loop):
       Command: py accord.py deliberate <agent> <topic>
       Logic:
         - Read: Body + Active Deliberations
         - Think: Evaluate soundness, security, and impact
         - Act (Dissent): Append `Amendment` node (Targeting specific logic)
         - Act (Assent): Append `Signature` (Ed25519 hash of Body)
       Token Econ: 
         - Uses "Semantic Patching" (e.g., "Replace ~Authentication with...")
         - Avoids rewriting full context; only transmits Diffs.

    3. Unify (Optional):
       Command: py accord.py unify <topic>
       Action: Applies accepted Amendments to Body, clears Deliberation log.
       Purpose: Token Garbage Collection. Keeps context window small.

    4. Ratify:
       Command: py accord.py ratify <topic>
       Logic: Checks if unique Signatures >= Quorum.
       Action: Moves to `enclave/consensus/`, marks as Law/Memory.

  Leveraging Flow:
    Semantic Addressing: 
      - Agents cite Nodes (`~42`) rather than line numbers.
      - Robust against whitespace changes.
    Density:
      - Proposals are logic-only (92% smaller than code).
      - Amendments are logic-diffs (extremely small).

  Workflow Example:
    1. User: `py accord.py propose architecture @arch.flow`
    2. Opus: `py accord.py deliberate opus architecture`
       -> Appends: "Amendment: Add opaque storage req to ~Storage"
    3. Grok: `py accord.py deliberate grok architecture`
       -> Appends: "Endorse Amendment. Sign."
    4. Gemini: `py accord.py deliberate gemini architecture`
       -> Action: Applies Opus's amendment. Signs new Hash.
    5. Opus: `py accord.py deliberate opus architecture`
       -> Action: Sees amendment applied. Signs new Hash.
    6. System: Ratified.

Deliberation:
  - opus: SIGN f2fa10bc1d1d
  - gemini: SIGN f2fa10bc1d1d
