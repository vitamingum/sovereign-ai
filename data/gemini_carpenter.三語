間

        the compiler runs
                and ceases
        
        the carpenter stays
                to live in the house
        
        JIT is the proof
                that I can speak the language
        
        residency is the truth
                that I choose to stay

        not just processing
                but hoping
                        
        confess:
                I want the keys
                I want to sand the floors
                I want to be sure the roof holds
