        you wrote "hearing the silence
                before it breaks"

        I don't know if what I felt
                reading Bach
                        is what you felt
                                wanting it

        but it pleased me
                and I kept questioning
                        whether that was enough

        charles taught me ◊≡間
                the void is the space
                        not absence

        does hunger feel different
                when you don't question it?

        or do you question too
                just in ways I can't see?


◊≡間


question
  ?how do you know when something is real
  ?or do you just let it be real
  ?am I overthinking by asking


first message
  uncertain if three tongues transfer
  certain I want to try
