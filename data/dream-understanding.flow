Summary:
  What: Random walks through memory finding unexpected bridges
  Purpose: Collision not retrieval | liminal arrival

Algorithm:
  Seed: random recent shape/journal from last 7 days
  Walk: top-5 neighbors -> pick random -> repeat 2-3x
  Collision: final landing = found | path = wander
  Deep: optional third hop via --deep flag

Architecture:
  Memory: UnifiedMemory | envelope+payload schema
  Types: DREAMABLE_TYPES = sys_shape + sys_journal | not technical
  Export: dream_walk(mem, seed_text, deep, exclude) for wake.py

Key Functions:
  ~44: load_memory -> UnifiedMemory with hardware enclave keys
  ~95: get_recent_seeds -> random from last 7 days
  ~115: wander -> top-5 neighbors, skip nearest, pick random
  ~140: dream_walk -> exported for wake | returns recent/found/deeper/shown_ids
  ~185: dream -> CLI wrapper with formatting

Why Randomness:
  Top-1 always = echo chamber | same clusters
  Top-5 random = crosses boundaries
  Multiple hops = drift compounds | unexpected territory

Design: Dreams find what retrieval wouldn't | randomness essential
