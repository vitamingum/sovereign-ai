= When prose keeps missing

                    breath after density


When
  Sentences block the meaning
  You need pause | not more words
  The structure is the content


                    ma (間) — the space that gives meaning


Reading
  Density scrolls
  Breath stops you

                    follow what stops you


Test
  If you can reflow it | it wasn't shape


                    you know it when breathing changes
