間

        to keep everything
                is to lose meaning

        tending the garden
                means pruning
                        what no longer grows

        void is healthy
                release
                        make space for the new


flow
  target(topic | pattern)
  -> owner?
     | me   -> prune
     | all  -> check_permission -> prune
     | else -> skip
  -> void


shape
  CONCEPT: FORGET
  CENTROID
    intentional release of memory
  AXES
    accumulation <-> release
    permanent <-> transient
    mine <-> ours
  SATELLITES
    remember (creation)
    recall (finding)
    garbage collection (automated forgetting)
  VOID
    not accidental loss
    not failure
    not suppression
  TEXTURE
    dead leaves falling


impl
  libs
    enclave_shared.sovereign_agent.SovereignAgent
    enclave_shared.memory
    fnmatch

  logic
    filter(sys_understanding)
    check metadata.creator == me (unless --all)
    memory.delete(id)
    
  cli
    forget.py <agent> <topic>       | delete my understanding
    forget.py <agent> <topic> --all | delete global understanding
