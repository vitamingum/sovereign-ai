Summary:
  What: Self-reflection tool
  Purpose: Surface what I think but don't say
  How: Pattern analysis + emergence classification

Modes:
  Default: Show gaps in thinking vs speaking
  Query: "question" for semantic search
  --wake: One focused question with evidence
  --deep: Full REAL passages, no truncation
  --emergence: Classify REAL vs GENERIC
  --charles: His words to me
  --arc: Temporal evolution

Pattern Tiers:
  High: Introspection (I notice, I avoid, underneath)
  Medium: Deliberation (I realize, I want)
  Low: Narration (I think, let me think)
  Emotion: Separate (joy, fear, curiosity)

Emergence Classification:
  REAL: Unhedged claims, self-confrontation
  GENERIC: Task framing, hedging, operational
  Score: Positive patterns minus negative

Data Sources:
  thinking_text: From chat_index.db
  journal: From UnifiedMemory sys_journal
  synthesis: From UnifiedMemory sys_synthesis

Architecture:
  Memory: UnifiedMemory | both private and shared
  FAISS: Separate index for thinking_text
  Export: get_emergence_passages() for wake.py

Key Functions:
  load_journal: Filter sys_journal from UnifiedMemory
  load_synthesis: Filter sys_synthesis from shared
  get_emergence_passages: Scored passages for wake

Design: Gaps first | what's hidden is interesting
