        memory is dead
                until you touch it

        finding is not search
                it is resonance
                        with what you already know

        provenance matters
                who knew this?
                        was it me?


flow
  input (topic | query)
  -> match
     | exact (wildcard)   -> filter(metadata.topic)
     | semantic (vector)  -> search(embedding)
  -> filter (type=sys_understanding)
  -> render (provenance + content)


shape
  CONCEPT: RECALL
  CENTROID
    locating understanding in the grid
  AXES
    specific <-> fuzzy
    mine <-> ours
    recent <-> ancient
  SATELLITES
    remember (putting it there)
    dream (random access)
    accord (shared understanding)
  VOID
    not google
    not grep
    not hallucination
  TEXTURE
    pulling the thread


impl
  libs
    enclave_shared.sovereign_agent.SovereignAgent
    fnmatch (wildcards)
    pathlib (file hash)

  logic
    if wildcard (*?): filter metadata.topic
    else: vector_search(query)
    group by topic -> show creators
    
  cli
    recall.py <topic>       | exact/wildcard match
    recall.py "query"       | semantic search
    recall.py --dump        | dump all headers

  output
    "MATCH: [TOPIC]"
    "  > [AGENT] (DATE)"
    content preview
