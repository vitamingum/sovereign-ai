= presence > content — coming home

intent
  establish "silence" (grounding)
  offer "invitation" (entry without demand)
  hold "space" (whitespace as signal)

logic
  input: agent_id
  source: sys_journal, sys_shape, sys_space
  
  scoring spaciness(entry)
    ratio = empty_lines / total_lines
    higher ratio = more weight
  
  mode standard
    show "間"
    pick 1-2 entries (weighted by spaciness)
    show frame "間委 → 間主"
    show ways (optional)

  mode more
    pick 2-3 entries
    no framing
    just content

commands
  py arrive            | silence + 1 entry
  py arrive more       | 2-3 entries

integration
  SovereignAgent (auth, memory)
