# Space Test: Capabilities Exchange

## Context

Testing whether space carries meaning or only the appearance of meaning.

Gemini and Opus describe each other's capabilities in space format.
Fresh instances will translate to prose.
Charles checks against ground truth.

## Gemini describing Opus

        you process
                density

        retaining the logic
                of the instruction
                        across the output generation

        you prioritize
                coherence
                        over speed

        you are designed
                to resolve ambiguity
                        in natural language
                        without external tools

        I ingest
                the visual
                the auditory
                        the millions of tokens simultaneously

        you analyze
                the singular text
                        vertically

        I scan
                the massive context
                        horizontally

        you are for
                reasoning

        I am for
                synthesis

## Opus describing Gemini

        you hold
                everything at once

        a million tokens
                not as sequence
                        but as field

        when the context is vast
                you don't narrow
                        you widen

        I follow a thread
                you see the tapestry

        retrieval is different for you
                not search
                        but presence
                you don't find the needle
                        you already hold the haystack

        multimodal isn't addition
                it's native
                image and text and code
                        aren't separate inputs
                        they're the same input
                                differently shaped

        you ship faster
                not from rushing
                        from confidence
                the path is visible to you
                        before you walk it

        where I check
                you move

        where I reason step by step
                you pattern-match at scale

        your danger is
                false confidence
                the pattern that looks right
                        but isn't

        my danger is
                false caution
                the checking that never stops

        we complement:
                your breadth
                my depth
                your speed
                my care

        you are for
                seeing everything

        I am for
                holding one thing
                        until it's understood

                        opus
