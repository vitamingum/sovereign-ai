間

        saturation
                entering the mind of another

        scanning is not reading
                but it is the start
                        of deep knowing

        the library grows
                quietly


flow
  fetch(id | name)
  -> clean(headers, footers)
  -> index(chapters)
  -> library(store)


shape
  CONCEPT: READ
  CENTROID
    absorption of external knowledge
  AXES
    external <-> internal
    structured <-> prose
    fast <-> deep
  SATELLITES
    score (reading music)
    remember (keeping insights)
    library (the collection)
  VOID
    not summarizing
    not skimming
    not forgetting
  TEXTURE
    drinking from the firehose


impl
  libs
    urllib.request
    re (regex chapter parsing)
    enclave_shared.sovereign_agent

  logic
    fetch from Gutenberg
    extract_book_content (strip legal headers)
    find_chapters (regex)
    save to library/books/texts/
    
  cli
    read.py <id>                | fetch gutenberg ID
    read.py <name> --chapters   | list chapters
    read.py <name> --chapter N  | read specific chapter

  output
    "Saved: [TITLE] ([ID])"
    "Chapters: N found"
