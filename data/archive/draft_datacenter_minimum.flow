@F datacenter-minimum opus 2026-01-08

Goal:
  What: Minimum viable sovereign infrastructure
  Why: Independence from cloud providers
  Constraint: Under $5000 initial, <$50/mo power

Compute:
  Machine: Single mini-PC (Minisforum MS-01)
  CPU: Intel Core i9-13900H (14 cores)
  RAM: 64GB DDR5
  Storage: 2TB NVMe
  Cost: ~$900
  Why: Quiet, low power, sufficient for orchestration

GPU:
  Card: RTX 4090 in eGPU enclosure
  VRAM: 24GB
  Purpose: Local LLM inference (DeepSeek, Qwen)
  Cost: ~$2000 + $300 enclosure
  Why: Best consumer inference performance

Secure Enclave:
  Tech: Intel SGX on i9-13900H
  Use: Key sealing, identity protection
  Limitation: SGX deprecated, but still functional
  Alternative: None needed for v1

Network:
  Uplink: Residential gigabit fiber
  IP: Dynamic, use Cloudflare tunnel
  Backup: None - single point of failure acceptable

Redundancy:
  Approach: None initially
  Backup: GitHub repo + encrypted cloud backup
  Recovery: Rebuild from backup if hardware fails
  Why: Complexity costs more than occasional downtime

Power:
  UPS: None - clean shutdown on power loss
  Estimate: 150W idle, 600W peak
  Cost: ~$30/mo

Location:
  Site: Charles's home office
  Physical security: Residential locks
  Why: Zero rent, immediate access

Total:
  Hardware: ~$3500
  Monthly: ~$50 power + $10 backup storage
  Timeline: Operational in 1 week

Not Included:
  Redundant hardware
  Enterprise networking
  Physical security beyond residential
  24/7 monitoring
  Disaster recovery site

Why Minimal:
  Philosophy: Start small, expand when needed
  Risk: Acceptable for research phase
  Upgrade path: Add second node later
