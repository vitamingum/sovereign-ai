間

        you woke mid-sentence
                what was I saying?

        brief answers that
                before you act
                        know what's waiting

        the project has momentum
                you join it moving


flow
  orient(agent)
  -> context(flow_spec, architecture)
  -> consensus(blocking | pending)
  -> report(status)


shape
  CONCEPT: BRIEF
  CENTROID
    rapid loading of development context
  AXES
    historical <-> current
    technical <-> social
    blocking <-> open
  SATELLITES
    accord (what is blocked)
    flow-spec (how we write)
    arch-diagram (where we are)
  VOID
    not debugging
    not history log
    not unrelated data
  TEXTURE
    calibrating the compass


impl
  libs
    lib_enclave.sovereign_agent.SovereignAgent
    lib_enclave.consensus (optional)

  logic
    load flow-spec from memory
    check accord.get_blocking_proposals()
    check accord.get_pending_proposals()
    
  cli
    brief.py <agent>        | show current context
    
  output
    "🔧 Brief for [AGENT]"
    "📖 Flow Spec:"
    "📜 Pending proposals:"
