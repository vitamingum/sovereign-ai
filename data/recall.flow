intent
  locate "understanding" by topic

  display "provenance" (who held it, when)

logic
  input: pattern (wildcard) OR query (semantic)
  filter: mem_type=sys_understanding
  
  mode pattern_match
    if wildcards (*?):
      match topic against pattern
    else:
      try exact topic match
      if none -> mode semantic_search

  mode semantic_search
    vector search (shared + private)
    return top-k matches with similarity score

  display
    group by topic
    show creator and timestamp
    filter stale entries (if file verification possible)

  py recall <topic>          | fetch concept
  py recall "<query>"        | semantic search
  py recall --literal <str>  | grep search
