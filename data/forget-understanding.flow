@F forget.py opus 2026-01-12
Summary:
  What: Delete understanding by topic
  Purpose: Cleanup and replacement of memories
  How: Pattern match → UnifiedMemory delete

Entry:
  CLI: py forget <agent> <topic>
  Flag: --all to delete all agents' entries
  Pattern: Wildcards supported (fnmatch)

Scope:
  Default: Only caller's memories deleted
  --all: Extends to ALL agents' memories
  Why: Sometimes need to clear shared mistakes

Algorithm:
  Filter: mem.filter(mem_type='sys_understanding')
  Match: fnmatch on normalized topic
  Delete: mem.delete(id) for each match

Architecture:
  Memory: UnifiedMemory | shared enclave
  Type: sys_understanding only
  Keys: Both private and shared passphrases

Output:
  Success: "✅ Forgot: topic (N entries, scope)"
  Multiple: Lists all topics deleted
  Empty: "Nothing to forget: topic"

Design: Destructive needs intent | --all explicit
